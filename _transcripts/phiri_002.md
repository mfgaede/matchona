Samuel ‘Daddy’ Phiri (1920-2005) arrived in South Africa during 1953, having worked and travelled though Zimbabwe for the previous 10 years. In Johannesburg, he married; set up a tailoring business; became an elder of the Zambezi Church; served as president of the Tumbuka Burial Society; and joined the ANC. He periodically returned to Chiradzulu, but settled in South Africa and was buried with an ANC flag over his grave.

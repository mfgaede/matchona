Harry Ngumbalo was recruited to South Africa on his first WNLA contract in 1972, at the age of 21. He was not yet married at the time. In this interview, he discusses his parents’ immediate acceptance of his decision to join the migration, the recruitment process, “mine school” on arrival, different roles in the mines such as “pass boys,” the accidents in which other miners lost fingers and limbs, the ways his family spent his remittances as well as the ways they set him up well for a later marriage, and the experience of returning to Malawi after his contract.

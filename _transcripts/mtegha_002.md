In 1951 Daih Mtegha (1930-n.d.) followed his father, Nkhunda Mtegha, to South Africa. He worked for a number of years in Cape Town as a medical assistant. By the mid-1950s however he had abandoned this profession to become a Jehovah's Witness missionary, a role that would define the rest of his later life both in South Africa and back in Malawi.

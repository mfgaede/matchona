Statement in South African National Archives, Pretoria GNLB 417 81/21 ‘Employment of Tropical Natives on Mines: Part II: Individual Applications’ (1926-1930). 

Born in Chinteche, Elias Chisenga arrived in Johannesburg during 1923, masquerading as a Mozambican WNLA recruit to gain employment as a cleaner and miner. Between 1925 and 1928, he repeatedly moved back and forth between South Africa and Chinteche, before applying for re-employment on the Johannesburg mines in mid-1929.

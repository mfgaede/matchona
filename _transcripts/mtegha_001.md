Nkhunda Mtegha (c.1910-1952) was the first of his family to migrate from Usisya to South Africa in 1932. The son of a chief, he decided to migrate in his early 20s as there were more opportunities abroad, working as a miner in Johannesburg. He returned to Malawi in 1952 and established a grocery store; many of descendants followed in his footsteps to South Africa.

Melrin Mtegha (1928-n.d.) was a housewife throughout her life, both in Malawi and South Africa. This however did not stop her having considerable influence within local politics and the Malawian Jehovah's Witness community. Her son Gilead Mtegha reflected in June 2014, his father Daih “was a firm believer - and my mother even more.” Converted by her husband in 1958, she remained active with the Blantyre Jehovah's Witness Women's Guild in 2014.

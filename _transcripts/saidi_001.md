Yusuf Saidi (1928-2005) was a “deeply religious” man. In May 2014 his daughter Sakina Mohamed recounted, “before anything he was a Muslim”. Travelling to South Africa in the mid-1950s, Yusuf worked in numerous mosques across the Transvaal, starting as a muezzin in Kerk Street, Johannesburg before establishing himself a well-respected and well-loved muazzin and imam in Marabastad from the 1960s. Also a spiritual healer and loving father, Yusuf spent his adult life in South Africa, only returning once to Malawi in 1987.

The interview took place on the October 11, 2023 at the Fort Johnstone Hotel in Mangochi. The discussion began at 9 AM and was a fruitful, free-ranging discussion. 

We spoke with Mrs. Margret Alabi Mitawa and Mrs. Samiyatu Zulu whose husband had travelled to South Africa on several occasions.

It is for this reasons we wanted to hear their stories. Their stories are important for the future of their children and grand-children and to inform the scholarly record.

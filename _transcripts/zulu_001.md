Elias P.K. Mandala conducted this interview with two wives of WNLA workers, Margret Alabi Mitawa and Samiyatu Zulu. Mitawa and Zulu hail from Katema and Namakumba, respectively, both within the Mangochi district. Mitawa is the wife of Alabi Mitawa while Mrs. Zulu's husband, Mr. Zulu, died in 1996.

In the interview, Mitawa and Zulu discuss the beginnings of their arranged yet ultimately committed and romantic marriages. For several minutes, they discuss the brutality of the Malawi Congress Party's hardliners in the Mangochi region immediately following independence in the 1960s as strongman Hastings Kumuzu Banda consolidated his personal power.

Mitawa and Zulu coincide on many points: their and their parents' support for their husbands' desires to sign a WNLA contract; their sadness at separating yet confidence that they and their husbands would remain loyal to each other; their fruitful participation in informal support groups with other WNLA wives; and their dedication to letter-writing back and forth with their husbands notwithstanding their formal illiteracy. Mitawa discussed the painful experience of her second child's death while her husband was away in South Africa.

Each woman recalled being the individual recipient of her husband's financial remittances, yet also shared the money with relatives on both sides of the family. Finally, both expressed their frustration with the end of that financial support with the labor recruitment program's termination by Banda.

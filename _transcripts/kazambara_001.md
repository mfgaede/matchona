Statement in South African National Archives, Pretoria GNLB 417 81/21 ‘Employment of Tropical Natives on Mines: Part II: Individual Applications’ (1926-1930). 

Born in Chinteche, Patterson Kazambara first came to work on the Johannesburg mines in 1913. After Malawians were banned from the mines as “tropical workers”, Kazambara rapidly moved between employment as a domestic servant in Germiston; a labourer in Potgietersrus; and a mabhalane (clerk) on Zebediela Estate, the largest orange-growing plantation in the world, which employed innumerable Central Africans; a hospital attendant in Johannesburg; on a diamond mine in South West Africa; a coal mine in Witbank.

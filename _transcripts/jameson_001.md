Letter from Anderson Chimbaza to the Director of Native Affairs, 27 January 1928, in South African National Archives, Pretoria GNLB 417 81/21 ‘Employment of Tropical Natives on Mines: Part II: Individual Applications’ (1926-1930)  

Between 1909 and 1927, Jameson worked on numerous gold and coal mines in Johannesburg, Witbank and Middelburg. In 1928, he applied to continue underground mine work. Unusually, he forwarded his application to the Government Native Labour Bureau through Anderson Chimbaza of the Nyasaland Native National Congress (NNNC). The NNNC had emerged in Johannesburg during 1918, protesting restrictions on the free movement of Malawian workers and their employment on the mines. Chimbaza was a former mine worker who deserted in 1904.

Statement by Mack Banda, 2 May 1927, in South African National Archives, Pretoria GNLB 417 81/21 ‘Employment of Tropical Natives on Mines: Part II: Individual Applications’ (1926-1930)

Mack Banda first emigrated to Johannesburg as a WNLA recruit in 1911, and worked underground for the next 15 years as a miner and supervisory “boss boy”. In 1926, he relocated to the Transvaal town of Ermelo, where his family lived. In mid-1927, he applied to be re-employed on the Johannesburg mines.

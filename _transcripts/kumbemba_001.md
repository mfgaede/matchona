<p>Pearson Kumbemba first traveled to Malawi in 1972, at the age of 21, upon finishing his “Leaving Certificate” (equivalent of eighth grade). His ability to attend school reflected his parents’ relatively prosperous position in the community. He decided to sign up with WNLA in order to acquire the funds he would need to woo a wife and establish a family. In the first interview, he describes the recruitment process, life in mine compounds, tensions and friendships across ethnic lines, and his job as a “Tchisa boy” (horse boy). He praises the food he was served and recalls reading newspapers. He contracted a respiratory disease but received medical treatment in South Africa and recovered. In the second interview, Kumbembe goes into more detail regarding his family’s background, his children (including their own journeys to South Africa), and the time he was able to save his son’s life using the bicycle he bought with money earned in South Africa. He discusses the reenlistment bonus that he never received as a result of the recruitment halt of 1974.</p>

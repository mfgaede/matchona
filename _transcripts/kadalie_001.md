## Robert Kadalie: The Autobiography of a Malawian Immigrant in Early 20th Century South Africa

### Preface

A labour recruiter, miner, waiter, cook, office clerk and builder – as well as trade union official – Robert Victor Kadalie led a remarkable life. His autobiography offers a crucial, and
unprecedented, insight into the life of a Malawian worker who travelled and worked across
southern Africa over the first half of the twentieth century. Uniquely, his life story recounts experiences of work in Johannesburg, Cape Town and East London between 1910 and 1954,
his relationships with family and friends, and his numerous battles with illness, harsh
employers and fraudsters. Over the course of his travels, Robert Kadalie encountered a
considerable number of family relations from northern Malawi, demonstrating that already by
1910 Malawians were prominent as clerks and miners in South Africa. And against his wishes,
Robert also found himself sucked into the political revolution amongst black workers led by
his younger brother Clements Kadalie, who stood at the head the first major black trade union
in African history, the Industrial and Commercial Workers’ Union of Africa (ICU). Allegedly,
Clements first came to South Africa to fetch his older brother, and Robert subsequently served
as an ICU official between 1929 and 1937. Somewhat inadvertently then, Robert Kadalie had
a crucial, if reluctant, influence on southern African history.

Robert Kadalie was born in Chifira village, northern Malawi, sometime in the early 1890s to
Musa and Fanny Cherwereni Nyamanda, two devout early Christian Tonga converts to the
United Free Church of Scotland (UFC). Musa was the son of Chiweyu, who served as chief of
Chifira between 1908 and 1924. Robert’s younger siblings were Clements, Mary, Dyna and
Simon Foster.[^1] Robert had a difficult relationship with Clements, in particular, and they repeatedly fought when they were growing up, to the consternation of their parents.[^2] Musa
prematurely died while establishing a new branch of the UFC in Loudon during 1904, and subsequently Fanny pushed for her children to be educated at the local mission schools. Having
learnt to read and write in English, Robert left Chifira sometime in 1909 along with seven
others from Chifira and nearby Chituka village, working his way south through Mozambique
where he was hired by a white recruiter for the Chamber of Mines, Mr Skinner. After working
as clerk, miner and domestic servant on the Rand, Robert moved to Cape Town. It was in Cape
Town that Robert met his future wife, Lillie, and settled first at 4 Assurance Lane.[^3] Clements
briefly lived with his brother when he arrived in Cape Town in early 1918, but he soon found
his own accommodation at 6 Morris Street. Between 1919 and 1929 - while his brother rose to
world-wide fame as leader of the ICU - Robert was employed as a messenger and clerk in the
Cape Town office of George Findlay, one of South Africa’s most prominent lawyers.

Through his younger brother, Robert had a crucial, if reluctant, influence on South African history. First, Robert’s autobiography alleges that Clements came to South Africa in 1918 in order to fetch his older brother, and return to their birth-place in Malawi.[^4] In response to Arthur Maimane’s obituary of Clements, Robert similarly wrote to the magazine Drum in 1952:[^5]

{% include feature/blockquote.html quote="I have read carefully the article appearing in the June DRUM about the late Clements Kadalie. You said the birth of this great man is still a mystery. It is not. I am the elder brother of the late Mr. Kadalie. His coming to Cape Town was because of me, and if you want more information about him you can send Mr DRUM to me," speaker="ROBERT KADALIE (SEN.)<br />Nyasaland Villa<br />
Wyukeng, Cape." %} 
Second, Clements Kadalie recounted to his family back in Malawi that he adopted the name of Kadalie because his brother was known as Robert Victor Kadalie in Cape Town (and he wanted to “fall in”).[^6] Third, Robert’s Cape Town employer, George Findlay, defended ICU cases in court on numerous occasions, a connection that was, perhaps, first established by Robert. Despite numerous legal victories in the mid-1920s, however, by the end of the decade the trade union was facing an increasing number of setbacks. The Durban branch of the ICU broke away from the main body in May 1928, and rumours of financial misconduct led to a collapse in member subscriptions Clements Kadalie resigned from the trade union in January 1929, and went on to establish a rival Independent ICU in March 1929.

After being dismissed from Findlay’s (allegedly because of his brother’s trade union organising), Robert found himself swept up in his younger brother’s new Independent ICU, and at the forefront of the 1930 East London general strike. Like many siblings their relationship was a contradictory combination of fractious loathing and love. Robert clearly had fluctuating opinions of both his brother and the “accursed” ICU. In 1923, even Nyasaland officials knew that Robert was “immensely jealous of his younger and more successful relative”.[^7] And in 1931, Robert told Clements, “Even Satan in hell is better [than you]. Sometimes he has pity on his brother angel[s] (THE SATAN).” But after his brother’s death in 1951, Robert told Clements’ son Alexander that although “we have many quarrels since our school days”, “no man has a love for his brothers [greater] than my self despite what my brother did to me.”[^8] The reputation of their difficult relationship was obviously well-known. During the East London general strike, Clements joked “let us all show a true African spirit. My brother Robert is having a boxing context with me tonight in St Phillips Hall, followed by a dance.”[^9] Robert’s autobiography, however, is notably silent about his prominence in the strike (where he regularly addressed meetings, and openly declared that “Clements Kadalie is the son of Jesus Christ”). Similarly, Robert fails to mention his subsequent role in the fragmentation of the Independent ICU, documented at length by another leader, Henry Daniel Tyamzashe in his own autobiographical history of the trade union. [^10] In September 1931, Robert was appointed as the King Williams Town branch secretary of the Independent ICU, where he was accused of meddling with local finances. During 1932, the trade union split into the Independent ICU under Magade, and the United ICU under Tyamzashe and the Kadalie brothers. Subsequently, Robert Kadalie lived in East London alternating between work as a
United ICU official and a fruit seller.

To a far greater extent than his brother, Robert was also in close touch with political
developments across the broader Malawian diaspora. When he first arrived in Johannesburg, he was in contact with a man named Chimbaza – possibly Anderson Chimbaza who was involved in the formation of the Nyasaland Native National Congress (NNNC), an early Malawian nationalist organisation that claimed around 500 members in the early 1920s. [^11] In 1938, Robert certainly stayed at the home of Juma Richardson Albert Ankhoma, a leading Pentecostal church leader and executive member of the NNNC, in Johannesburg, and he was later on the NNNC mailing list in the 1940s. [^12] In 1939, when Robert applied to work for the
newly-formed Nyasaland government labour department offices in Johannesburg, he asserted:
{% include feature/blockquote.html quote="My name is well known in Nyassaland where my late Grandfather, Chiweyu Banda of Bandawe, was a foremost chief, and for that reason, as well as my knowledge of the Nyassa and English language, many of my countrymen would appreciate to see me included in some capacity in this Labour Agency’s Offices." %}
By this point, Robert was “in no way connected with my brother’s (Clements Kadalie)
propaganda and activities”.[^13] Robert also remained actively involved in chiefly politics back in colonial Malawi. He wrote to Clements and Clements’ son, Alexander, about the coronation of Ernest Alexander Muwamba as acting Chief Chiweyu in 1944.14 When he attended Clements Kadalie’s funeral in December 1951, Robert was one of many Malawians who sang ‘Abide with Me’ in Chitonga. Professor Davidson Don Jabavu emphasised at the funeral that Clements’ “ability as an African from Nyasaland to unite Africans from other parts of showed us the oneness of Africa.”[^15]

Robert Kadalie’s autobiography, in part, appears to have been an attempt to secure his own, more ambiguous, legacy. The original manuscript seems to have been written in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and subsequently added to in the final years before Robert’s passing. The autobiography (previously only known to the close family) was given to me by Robert’s grandson, Lesley Nazombe, in Cape Town during August 2017, while I was researching a PhD on the life of Clements Kadalie. The original document consists of innumerable long sentences with few breaks or punctuation. I have kept the original paragraphing, but to make the manuscript more easily readable, I have added punctuation – full stops, commas and apostrophes – where appropriate. Where I have added letters or words, these are in square brackets, so the original text remains. Unfortunately at least 5 pages are missing from the original document, including the 2 opening pages. I have also split the text in to two parts, in order to insert a sample of two contemporary police reports from the 1930 East London general strike, which capture some of Robert’s vivid oratory on behalf of the Independent ICU (performances which he marginalises in his own life story).

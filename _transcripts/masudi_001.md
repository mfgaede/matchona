Mmadi Kalonga Masudi is the son of a migrant worker. At the time of the interview, he was the Vice Board Chair of Ex-Miners Association of Malawi as well as the Mangochi District Secretary. Masudi’s father traveled to work in South Africa in 1973-74 and died shortly thereafter due to tuberculosis which had contracted in the mines. Interviewee discusses the ways that his father’s financial support from South Africa proved pivotal for the family, for example by funding the children’s education. Now a grown man himself, Masudi focuses significant energy on trying to claim re-enlistment bonuses that were denied to his father’s generation of miners after the recruitment halt of 1974.

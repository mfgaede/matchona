<p>Alabi Mitawa, a Muslim man from Katema (30 km from Mangochi), left on his first WNLA contract in 1964, at the age of 20. He completed three contracts with WNLA, with the final one concluding in 1973. He was married with one child when he left for his first contract. While away on his third contract, his third child died as a baby. In the first interview, he recounts the process of recruitment and screening, life in the mine barracks, learning Fanagalo (the language developed for workers in the mines), and consumer purchases he made. His nostalgic view of his time with WNLA is reinforced by his pride at the house he was able to build for his family upon his return. In the second interview, he elaborates upon his familyâ€™s background, discussions with his wife about whether to begin labor migration, the process of communicating with family and sending them remittances, and his feelings about the end of the migration program in 1974.</p>

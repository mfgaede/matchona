Statement in South African National Archives, Pretoria GNLB 417 81/21 ‘Employment of Tropical Natives on Mines: Part II: Individual Applications’ (1926-1930). 

Born in Chinteche, Samuel John arrived in Johannesburg in 1908 and found work underground as a miner and supervisory “boss boy”. After Malawians were banned from the mines, John worked at a boarding house in Benoni between 1914 and 1919, before returning to the mines in 1920. By 1926, he was living in the married quarters at Rose Deep mine.

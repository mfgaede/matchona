Statement in South African National Archives, Pretoria GNLB 417 81/21 ‘Employment of Tropical Natives on Mines: Part II: Individual Applications’ (1926-1930).

Elias Kandowe arrived in Johannesburg during 1914, masquerading as a Mozambican WNLA recruit. He worked as a miner and supervisory “boss boy” until 1925, when he entered private employment in Boksburg and Barberton, where he settled with his family. In mid-1927, he applied to return to the Johannesburg mines as a policeman.

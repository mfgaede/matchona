## Summary

Elias P.K. Mandala conducted this group interview with Modesta Lingison Brahim (MB), Delia Baston Mawilo (DM), Aisha Bakali (AB), Teresa Saiwala (TS), all wives of men—some living and some deceased at the time of the interview—who traveled to South Africa with WNLA and/or TEBA between the 1960s and 1980s (with the bulk of trips taking place in the 1970s). 

The interview was conducted in Mangochi district, where all of these women currently live. However, two of the women were born elsewhere in Malawi and had moved to Mangochi for economic reasons. The women discussed growing up as the daughters of subsistence farmers with additional pressures to procure money via wage labor and/or selling some of their maize and cassava. They fully supported their husbands’ intentions to try to get WNLA contracts, yet shared emotional details about the difficulties the arrangements posed. They discussed the pain of saying goodbye, as well as fears about their husbands getting injured, dying, or marrying other women in South Africa. Most though not all felt lonely in their husbands’ absence, but exchanged letters with their husbands even if they had to rely on friends to write them or read them aloud. They relied on informal support groups with other migrant miners’ wives to cope. At the same time, they appreciated how their husbands’ wages from South Africa improved their families’ housing and education prospects, and allowed them to own desirable consumer goods. Finally, they discussed communally supervised rituals for reuniting with their husbands when they returned home at the end of each contract. Finally, while men interviewed for this project universally lamented the end of the program after the plane crash of 1974, these women expressed more mixed and circumspect views about the decision.

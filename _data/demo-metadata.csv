kumbemba_001,,Interviews with Pearson Kumbemba: Migrant to South Africa,"Mandala, Elias P.K.",2022-04-23,,"Pearson Kumbemba first traveled to Malawi in 1972, at the age of 21, upon finishing his “Leaving Certificate” (equivalent of eighth grade). His ability to attend school reflected his parents’ relatively prosperous position in the community. He decided to sign up with WNLA in order to acquire the funds he would need to woo a wife and establish a family. In the first interview, he describes the recruitment process, life in mine compounds, tensions and friendships across ethnic lines, and his job as a “Tchisa boy” (horse boy). He praises the food he was served and recalls reading newspapers.  He contracted a respiratory disease but received medical treatment in South Africa and recovered. In the second interview, Kumbembe goes into more detail regarding his family’s background, his children (including their own journeys to South Africa), and the time he was able to save his son’s life using the bicycle he bought with money earned in South Africa. He discusses the reenlistment bonus that he never received as a result of the recruitment halt of 1974.",Interethnic relations; bicycles; newspapers; remittances; bonus,"Mangochi, Malawi",-14.46,35.27,"Mandala, Elias P.K.; Kumbemba, Pearson",,Record,compound_object,English,,,compound_object,,,/transcripts/kumbemba_001.html,,,

His autobiography offers a crucial, and unprecedented, insight into the life of a Malawian worker who travelled and worked across southern Africa over the first half of the twentieth century. Uniquely, his life story recounts experiences of work in Johannesburg, Cape Town and East London between 1910 and 1954, his relationships with family and friends, and his numerous battles with illness, harsh employers and fraudsters. Over the course of his travels, Robert Kadalie encountered a considerable number of family relations from northern Malawi, demonstrating that already by 1910 Malawians were prominent as clerks and miners in South Africa. And against his wishes, Robert also found himself sucked into the political revolution amongst black workers led by his younger brother Clements Kadalie, who stood at the head the first major black trade union in African history, the Industrial and Commercial Workers’ Union of Africa (ICU). Allegedly, Clements first came to South Africa to fetch his older brother, and Robert subsequently served as an ICU official between 1929 and 1937. Somewhat inadvertently then, Robert Kadalie had a crucial, if reluctant, influence on southern African history.",recruiter; miner; waiter; cook; clerk; trade unionist; Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union of Africa; Johannesburg; Cape Town; East London; Port Elizabeth,"Cape Town, South Africa",-33.925278,18.423889,University of Glasgow,,Record,compound_object,English,In Copyright -- Educational Use Permitted.

The interview was conducted in Mangochi district, where all of these women currently live. However, two of the women were born elsewhere in Malawi and had moved to Mangochi for economic reasons. The women discussed growing up as the daughters of subsistence farmers with additional pressures to procure money via wage labor and/or selling some of their maize and cassava. They fully supported their husbands’ intentions to try to get WNLA contracts, yet shared emotional details about the difficulties the arrangements posed. They discussed the pain of saying goodbye, as well as fears about their husbands getting injured, dying, or marrying other women in South Africa. Most though not all felt lonely in their husbands’ absence, but exchanged letters with their husbands even if they had to rely on friends to write them or read them aloud. They relied on informal support groups with other migrant miners’ wives to cope. At the same time, they appreciated how their husbands’ wages from South Africa improved their families’ housing and education prospects, and allowed them to own desirable consumer goods. Finally, they discussed communally supervised rituals for reuniting with their husbands when they returned home at the end of each contract. Finally, while men interviewed for this project universally lamented the end of the program after the plane crash of 1974, these women expressed more mixed and circumspect views about the decision.

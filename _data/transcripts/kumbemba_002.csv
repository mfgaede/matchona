,EM:,Again we meet today on 16th January here at Mangochi. We thank God for the New Year. Happy New Year!,Mangochi,,,
,PK:,Happy New year to you too Mr. Elias,,,,
,EM:,"Yes, let this be the year of progress in our work, families, and in all what we aspire to achieve during the year",,,,
,PK:,Very true let God bless us all,,,,
,EM:,How is home?,,,,
,PK:,Home is fine. How about where you come from?,,,,
,EM:,"No, everyone there is fine. It is good that we meet like this unlike through the phone. Our interaction would have been artificial.",,,,
,PL:,"Very true. This is very good unlike if it was through the phone, as there so many issues of network down here. With that we could find ourselves lost and the chat would have been a bit weird. In addition, unending blackouts we could have our phones dead.",,,,
,EM:,Yes it is becoming terrible now with brownouts. But thank you for accepting my call and to come for this interview. We do appreciate.,,,,
,PK:,"You are welcome, and feel free to ask me any questions.",,,,
,EM:,I already have all your details; I will not labor to ask you questions on that.,,,,
,PK:,"Oh okay, Sir",,,,
,EM:,My first question is about your grandparents. Where did they come from? Do you know or heard them talk about it?,,,,
,PK:,"My grandfather came from Lingamasa, within the district, across the Shire River.",Mangochi,,,
,EM:,"Oh, Lingamasa the opposite side of the river?",,,,
,PK:,Yes that’s where he came from then.,,,,
,EM:,Under which Traditional Authority (T/A)?,Traditional Authorities,,,
,PK:,That was T/A Jowe,Traditional Authorities,,,
,EM:,"Oh ok, T/A Jowe. When was that?",Traditional Authorities,,,
,PK:,That was around 1964. But he passed on since.,1960s,,,
,EM:,Oh sorry and when was that? Would you know?,1970s,,,
,PK:,That would be around 1970s. More exact in 1972 that was when I was leaving for South Africa to work in the mine WNLA.,1970s,,,
,EM:,Oh is that so? And would you know when he was born?,1970s,,,
,PK:,"Oh that would be a while in the late 1800s. Because the time he passed on, he was saying he as above 100 years old. ",family,,,
,EM:,Oh yeah that’s a mirage.,family,,,
,PK:,Definitely. That should be in the 1870s for sure. Because even I was born he was already an old fellow.,family,,,
,EM:,Was he married then? Was he leaving with his wife?,family,,,
,PK:,Actually she was my granny am talking about. When I was born her husband was already dead. So I never saw him.,family,,,
,EM:,Oh! My apologies. I thought we are talking of your grandfather.,family,,,
,PK:,"No, I never saw him.",family,,,
,EM:,Where was he then? Was he alive?,family,,,
,PK:,"He was dead when I was born. So I didn’t know much about him. Also, when I was born, my granny was then living with my mom.",family,,,
,EM:,Is it because of the matrilineal family set up that made it possible that you met and lived with your granny?,family,,,
,PK:,"Very true according to our culture here, my dad would only come to my mom’s family to establish his family. He would not be a reliable figure in terms of my family lineage. He could easily be ditched out if the family of my mother felt enough of him. So it could be that my grandpa was chased away from the family the time I was born. ",family,,,
,EM:,"Oh is that so? That’s very sad not so? ",Mangochi,,,
,PK:,"That’s how it happens here. Actually probably after his death (grandpa) or disappearance, my grandma moved from that side to this side of the river to a place called Saiti Kadzuwa. That’s where the family settled till we were born.",Mangochi,,,
,EM:,Oh I see. So you moved to Saiti Kadzuwa after his death?,Mangochi,,,
,PK:,"Yes when he died, my granny moved from there to settle at Saiti Kadzuwa with my mom.",Mangochi,,,
,EM:,"So, tell me which T/A now?",Mangochi,,,
,PK:,This area is within TA Mponda.,Mangochi,,,
,EM:,Tell me what was your grandparents’ occupation? I am sure they would talk about it?,Mangochi,,,
,PK:,Oh yes. They were farmers. They used to grow groundnuts and sweet potatoes. They would. They had big farms and would grow huge sweet potatoes. They were popular too.,family,,,
,EM:,E:Was that time when your grandparents were married and lived together?,family,,,
,PK:,Yes they were married and lived together as a family. They were great farmers.,family,,,
,EM:,Were they selling their produce?,family,,,
,PK:,"Yes they were growing for sell. They would sell upon harvesting groundnuts and potatoes, sweet potatoes though not Irish potatoes.",family,,,
,EM:,Do people grow Irish potatoes here?,family,,,
,PK:,No we don’t only sweet potatoes,family,,,
,EM:,Alright. So tell me about your dad. Where was he born?,family,,,
,PK:,My dad was born at Mpondasi.,Mangochi,,,
,EM:,Oh Mpndansi not Mponda? What is the difference?,Mangochi,,,
,PK:,Actually Mponda is a chief (Traditional Authority T/A) while Mpondasi is a village. Many people easily confuse,Mangochi,,,
,EM:,"Oh I see, I actually get confused too each time I get across these two names. Thanks for clarification",Mangochi,,,
,PK:,Yes Mponda is T/A while Mpondasi is village headman.,Mangochi,,,
,EM:,Are they related?,Mangochi,,,
,PK:,No. They are not related at all. And if you notice every current chief will retain those names and their titles. It comes from bloodline.,Mangochi,,,
,EM:,"Now I understand the difference. So tell me when your dad and mom got married and settled at Mpondasi, what was their occupation?",Mangochi,,,
,PK:,"When they settled at Mpondasi, both parents were farmers. But my father was also a butcher man. He owned a butcher that sold meet to many people within the area.",Mangochi,,,
,EM:,So he owned a butcher? That means he was rich and you were lucky to be born from a rich family then,family,,,
,PK:,Yes. We were selling to the white people (Azungu {plural}) as well. Also I remember selling more meat to the army barracks especially at Monkyebay (Marine).,family,,,
,EM:,Oh yes that means this business was big? And those armies were then run by the British?,family,,,
,PK:,Exactly it was huge business for the family. Those white British in the army liked our meat. They always bought from our butchery,family,,,
,EM:,"Oh ok. Around this period most of people moved from one area to the other and abroad too for various reasons like poverty, security, employment, witchcraft, and land for agricultural purposes. Were your grandparents and dad and mom involved in these mentioned movements? If yes from where to where?",family,,,
,PK:,No my parents did not move. Even my grandparents did not have to make such moves.,family,,,
,EM:,Wow. That means they were comfortable. So would I be correct to assume you were the first in your family to have travelled abroad to South Africa?,family,,,
,PK:,Yes I was the first to have travelled abroad then.,family,,,
,EM:,Wow! So you were the torchbearer as a migrant worker in your entire family?,family,,,
,PK:,Yes. I am the only one.,family,,,
,EM:,So who else in your family every travelled abroad for work purposes?,family,,,
,PK:,So far only my kids have travelled abroad. They are in South Africa.,family,,,
,EM:,Oh Wow! Are they working in the mines in South Africa like you did?,family,,,
,PK:,Oh No. They are working in different companies not in the mines.,family,,,
,EM:,Wow! That is following your footsteps right?,family,,,
,PK:,"Definitely, they know that they went to school with the money from WNLA. So they had to go abroad to restart their lives.",education,,,
,EM:,This is wonderful! So they have benefited from the WNLA money?,education,,,
,PK:,You are right. They are the direct beneficiaries.,education,,,
,EM:,How do you compare them today and of your years? Do they support back home as you were doing?,education,,,
,PK:,Yes. They are very supportive. They are supporting us as parents just as I used to do to my parents and my immediate family. So far they have not lost it.,education,,,
,EM:,"Wow! That’s encouraging. I have heard about what younger generation of migrant workers from Malawi to South Africa is known for unlike your generation. Mostly, are known for binge drinking, womanizing etc. Most of them have forgotten about their homes. But your kids are a little bit different here.",education,,,
,PK:,You are absolutely right. Young people go to South Africa without any goal. Hence they miss their objectives and lose themselves to worldly things. They tend to lose focus too. But my children are exceptional. They look after each other; remind each other about home etc. They meet each other often. I also try to encourage them to focus.,education,,,
,EM:,That’s fascinating. Keep encouraging them.,,,,
,PK:,Back to your family lineage:,family,,,
,EM:,"Tell me, where did your grand grandparents come from? Say you’re the parents of your grandmother? Where did she come from? Did they tell you their story?",family,,,
,PK:,"In hearing them, her telling me a story, she said, her parents came from Mozambique side at a place called, YAOH.",family,,,
,EM:,"By the way you are tribe is Yao, so could this be the origins of your tribe?",family,,,
,PK:,"Exactly, I am Yao. Many Yao people came from this place in Mozambique. Now we attribute this place as our original home.",family,,,
,EM:,But would you know why they moved from Mozambique to Malawi?,family,,,
,PK:,Yes. They moved away from the political hardship of the Portuguese government. The British government in Malawi was very fair and friendly.,family,,,
,EM:,That’s a good point to note as most of us do not know where we truly come from. Our children are not taught these histories and origins. So you are lucky to know this.,family,,,
,PK:,"Exactly, we know where we come from. Yaoh is our original place, and we came into this country running away from the Portuguese.",family,,,
,EM:,Would you know when were parents born?,family,,,
,PK:,"I am not sure of my father birthdate, but my mother was born in 1922. ",1920s,,,
,EM:,Oh okay. So who was older between your mother and father?,1920s,,,
,PK:,My father was older than my mother.,1920s,,,
,EM:,"Oh Okay, 1922.",1920s,,,
,PK:,Though I heard from his friends that he was born around 1901.,family,,,
,EM:,Wow! 1901. He was older than your mother. So was it also possible that older men could marry younger girls in those days?,marriage,,,
,PK:,Yes. His friends/peers say so. He was older when he married my mother. True it was also happening in those days that older people could marry younger girls. My mother and father is the example.,marriage,,,
,EM:,Oh I see. Nowadays is very common that older men marrying younger girls.,marriage,,,
,PK:,"Yes it was happening then, and now it is also very popular older men marrying younger girls even as younger as 15 years. As long as there is love between them it is possible.",marriage,,,
,EM:,"So how many children were born in your family? ",family,,,
,PK:,We were born seven (7) children,family,,,
,EM:,How many boys and girls?,family,,,
,PK:,We were four girls and three boys.,family,,,
,EM:,"SO out of the seven children born in your family, how many did travel or contracted by WNLA? Was it only you?",WNLA,,,
,PK:,I was the only one who was contracted by WNLA. And the only one who travelled to South Africa except for my own children as I explained earlier.,WNLA,,,
,EM:,"so it means you didn’t influence others in your family to join WNLA as you did? In most my families when one goes abroad, tend to influence others to follow suit. ","WNLA, Witwatersrand Native Labour Association",,,
,PK:,No. None in the family really joined me or went to South Africa to work in the mines as I did.,"WNLA, Witwatersrand Native Labour Association",,,
,EM:,So what position was in the family?,family,,,
,PK:,"I was second. The first born is my brother, I am second.",family,,,
,EM:,Oh! Okay. So the rest were women? I mean after you?,family,,,
,PK:,Yes the rest that came after me were women and one boy. The first born is still working at Mkopola lodge at the bar at the golf area. He did not go to WNLA like me. When you go there you will see him and also on the walls as the first barman.,family,,,
,EM:,"Oh really! So him is the first born, you are second, who else?",family,,,
,PK:,"Yes, him first, me second, then came a woman, woman,  woman, man, and woman.",family,,,
,EM:,Oh! Really? So where are they now?,family,,,
,PK:,Yes that’s how our family is structured.  And they are all at home now,family,,,
,EM:,By the way did you marry before or after you came back from WNLA?,marriage,,,
,PK:,"I married after I came back. Remember, I went to South Africa to that I get money to marry my wife.",marriage,,,
,EM:,So you married when you came back first or after your second journey?,marriage,,,
,PK:,By the way I only went once not twice.,marriage,,,
,EM:,Oh Why?,marriage,,,
,PK:,"When the plane crashed, Kamuzu curtailed the business with WNLA. We could no longer go back. It was only later after 1975 when they opened TEBA when people could back to South Africa to work in the mines.",1974 plane crash,,,
,EM:,"So you went to South Africa, your elder brother started working at the bar at the golf club, what about the rest of the brother and sisters? What did they do?",family,,,
,PK:,"True, but the rest were not working. Instead they got married. Some managed to go to school and eventually got married",family,,,
,EM:,So while in South Africa did you manage to help your siblings with money back home? Or you just ignored? Or you concentrated on making more money to help with your future wedding?,family,,,
,PK:,"Yes, I used to send parents with money to help them with school fees and food. As they were young, I could only send my parents.",Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,EM:,"Oh yes, how were you sending such monies? Tell me more on this?",Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,PK:,We used to send money through the airmail.,Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,EM:,Airmail? How did it go? Explain.,Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,PK:,"Actually, we could send through the post office. We usually go to the post office to deposit the exact amount of money. Then the post office would send to Malawi. And in Malawi our relatives are notified of the money. They go to the local post office and then they get the money. It was that easy.",Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,EM:,"Is that so? But some told me that they used colleagues those going back home. When they arrive home they would give their relatives say R10, these colleagues would ask that recipient to write a letter confirming receipt of the money (R10). When the sender receives this confirmation letter from the recipient, gives that equivalent to the colleague who is back from home. This method was based on trust not so?",Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,PK:,"True, trust was paramount. Some people used this method but not many people actually used it.",Remittances (voluntary and forced);letters,,,
,EM:,"When telling me about your story earlier on, you said when you finished school, STD8; you left for South Africa (WNLA). How old were you by this period?",marriage,,,
,PK:,"When I left for South Africa, I was then 20 years old.",marriage,,,
,EM:,Wow! That was a young age? And you left for you to get money to marry your future wife.,marriage,,,
,PK:,"P. Yeah, I was young. I knew for me to marry I needed some good money. Unlike today, many young men just get married even when they don’t have anything. They even marry at a tender age",marriage,,,
,EM:,Exactly. Many young people today marry early; they also grow fast due to the type of food such as sausages. But 20 years was really young to take such a mantle of going to WNLA.,marriage,,,
,PK:,Oh yes children today grow fast and want to do things quicker. As for me 20 year was younger as you may see on my picture.,marriage,,,
,EM:,Oh yes can I have a look at your picture again? May I scan it?,marriage,,,
,PK:,"Yes go ahead. I look young but my problems made me mature fast. Even when I went to the mines, I was given some responsibilities due to the levels of my education. Our manager liked me. Young and energetic and could speak English. I could communicate well with them.",Bonuses,,,
,EM:,Is that so? So they could differentiate,Bonuses,,,
,PK:,Yes. You can also take a picture of this bonus card. I think I didn’t have it last time,Bonuses,,,
,EM:,Oh yes. You kept it very clean. You must have taken a good care of it. Is this card that you are using for the reported compensation program?,Bonuses,,,
,PK:,Yes that the card. You are to be considered only if you have this bonus card (which was never paid),Bonuses,,,
,EM:,again how did you reach at the idea of going to WNLA for work?,marriage,,,
,PK:,This decision was made based on the reason I already mention that I did not have the money to start a family with. I need to work harder to raise funds to facilitate my wedding with my then future wife.,marriage,,,
,EM:,So WNLA was the only option for you to raise such funds? If yes why then taking this dangerous option?,marriage,,,
,PK:,"There was an alternative. However, I chose the WNLA one because this one guaranteed success faster unlike the other one which would have taken a long time, with much uncertainty. ",marriage,,,
,EM:,What was that option?,marriage,,,
,PK:,"I could have done business like the one my dad was doing, especially butchery and farming. This option was not certain. I didn’t know how long it would take me to raise such funds.",family,,,
,EM:,You also said during our previous interview that you came from a business background. Would you tell me where did your father get the capital for his business?,family,,,
,PK:,My dad got his money from his pension and gratuity from where he used to work. He used to mention Railways. So he used that money to start up his business empire.,family,,,
,EM:,Oh great. So you mean you dad used to work for Railways?,family,,,
,PK:,Yes he was working there,family,,,
,EM:,Did you ever see him working there at Railways?,family,,,
,PK:,"No. I was born when he had already retired. So we only heard stories that he worked for railways. So, his pension was used to kick-start his business.",family,,,
,EM:,"So, at railways he was working as whom? What position?",family,,,
,PK:,He was working as a cook. He used to cook for workers and servicemen and shipmen. That time it was Chancy Maple ship. That was way back before the current popular Ilala ship.,family,,,
,EM:,Oh! Is that so? I thought he worked for ground railway line. And was he also cooking for the passengers?,family,,,
,PK:,No he was not cooking for passengers at all. There were only white/European workers no African at all. Africans were not well trained then except for the cooks,family,,,
,EM:,"So upon his retirement, your dad went into business. What kind of business?",family,,,
,PK:,"He used his money to open a shop and butchery. But after that, he went into serious farming. By the time of his death, he had closed his shop and had gone into farming ",family,,,
,EM:,"Wow, so it means you did not face economic difficulties while growing up?",capital,,,
,PK:,Oh yes. I was very lucky. But I went to experience real hard work in the mines in South Africa while trying to raise my own money,capital,,,
,EM:,Oh okay. How was it in the mines?,miner,,,
,PK:,"Eh in South Africa, in the mines we really faced hard work. I felt it, experienced it the hard work. It was strange especially coming from a well to do family. I remember others who came with us, decided to withdraw just after seeing the mines, the steps going down, the cage . It was not a place for lazy man. But I grew up in confidence and worked there for two years. It was not a joke. It was a do or die, a risk to go down there to the end of the mine.",miner,,,
,EM:,Wow! Pure hardship.,miner,,,
,PK:,And we were not going in upright but with bended necks. The path was too small. And we could walk miles underneath without stretching our backs. We tied some kind of flex-form material on our knees to help us sustain movement. It was tough. We sweated for our dime really.,miner,,,
,EM:,Oh! Yes. I saw that somewhere else.,miner,,,
,PK:,"It was a torcher. We were tying those flex forms both in our elbows and knees just to get to the destination. The path was too small for us to turn around or stretch our necks. If you do, you could hit the wall, it was very narrow.",miner,,,
,EM:,Wow!,miner,,,
,PK:,"It is very painful and discouraging that these people aren’t giving us compensation for the work we did without any reservations. The government should indeed work with them that we get something from the hardship we did. We made a lot of money for them. It is ethically right that they now compensate us. And just because they did not themselves go underneath, they should not accept the damage done to most of us.",Bonuses,,,
,EM:,"Tell me how would you have felt if the money you were sending back home to your parents, relatives was mismanaged?",Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,PK:,I would have felt very bad considering the painful means of getting that money. I would definitely get mad. In my case I was sending to my parents who knew how to use money well. They didn’t disappoint me.,Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,EM:,"Oh yes. However, many people tend to abuse such monies they didn’t sweat for.",Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,PK:,Correct. Most people enjoy spending lavishly proceeds of other people’s sweat. It would be unfair to misuse money gotten from the hardship in the mines.,Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,EM:,True.,Remittances (voluntary and forced),,,
,PK:,Now that you shared your decision to migrate to South Africa to work in the mines especially just after finishing school (STD8). How did your parents respond? You could have gone for further studies.,education;marriage,,,
,EM:,"P: True, I could have gone further with my studies but then my parents were not having the money to pay for my school fees. Instead I chose to go to South Africa to look for money that would have helped me with my plans to marry. ",education;marriage,,,
,PK:,E: So what was the immediate reaction from your parents? Especially considering that you just finished STD 8?,education;marriage,,,
,EM:,"P: Actually, they did not stand in my way at all, they supported me. However, even if they chose to control me, I would still go as I already had all the papers done. I would have just sneaked out and report to WNLA officials. I was very determined.",education;marriage,,,
,PK:,"But the family supported my decision. They also knew that STD 8 was like the end of my school next is marriage and work. ",education;marriage,,,
,EM:,How?,education;marriage,,,
,PK:,The issue is that Std 8 then was like Form4 where you are almost finished with school. It was more like send off to marriage or to seek job opportunities. So my parents had to some extent such expectations. So my decision was not totally surprising to them.,education;marriage,,,
,EM:,Very true indeed that Std.8 was today form 4. And also to be in STD 8 in those days would be old enough to start a family. So tell me when you came back what happened? Did you find your parents already arranged a wife for you?,education;marriage,,,
,PK:,When I came back home I looked for my wife. When I found her I got married to her and I have seven children with her. My parents did not look for a wife for me. I did not ask them to do so.,marriage,,,
,EM:,"Wow! That’s a good achievement for you especially achieving your objective for going to work in the mines in South Africa under WNLA. But tell me, how was your childhood? ",,,,
,PK:,You mean my youth years?,,,,
,EM:,Yes especially when your youthful years were around the struggle for Malawi’s independence? Tell me anything that you can remember.,,,,
,PK:,"Oh yes, I remember when Kamuzu came back home, 1950s, brought a lot of enthusiasm. We joined Youth League where we were so organized. Each time Kamuzu came around, we would line up in the streets to allow him pass through. He was a hero that we adored as teenagers. We were taught to be respectful. We could go around and take care of the aged. We had good manners.",1950s;Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,Wow! That was really nice. Am sure Kamuzu loved that,Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,PK:,"Yes he did. When I grew big, I went to join Malawi Young Pioneer (MYP) where were taught to be fit and a man.",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,All really? Tell me more about?,Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,PK:,True I was there but I only stayed for 2 years. That was from 1964 to 1967. I left them in 1968. We were fully trained,Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,But then you were very young considering you were born in 1951?,Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,PK:,"Yes I was. At MYP, Kamuzu only wanted young men and women. They did not want older people. They want to train them hence adults were not welcome at all.",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,"So you joined after the independence? And what were you trained in? ",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,PK:,"Yes they came to our schools and picked a few fit individuals to join the Malawi Young Pioneers. I was lucky I was also chosen to join them. While there, I was trained in farming. It was tough training. It involved hard work. We were also taught discipline, resilience, and hard work.",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,Oh! Ok. So there was much training?,Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,PK:,"Yes. Some were trained in engineering, construction, and farming. This organization was very helpful to most young Malawians.",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,"So by the time you were leaving for South Africa, you were already used to hard work?",,,,
,PK:,Yes I was already used to hard work and it was not difficult at all at the mine.,,,,
,EM:,What were the main pillars that you learnt from your time at Malawi Young Pioneers?,Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,PK:,"The main pillars include the fearless, resilience, and discipline. These were key to our survival while in. these pillars made me standout at the mine",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,"In 1964 uprising, when Kamuzu and his key ministers like Masauko Chipembere, who hailed from here, where were you? What side did you take?",Hastings Kamuzu Banda;1960s,,,
,PK:,"I remember very well about this uprising. Kamuzu first time met his equals. The country was at stand still. People were divided. There were two sides. You were with Kamuzu or with rebel ministers. In my case I followed Kamuzu, that guy brainwashed us to believe in him. He was a superhuman. We betrayed our own man Chipembere, and realized later that we made mistake.",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,"if you were given a chance to choose between the two, whom you choose with the background you have of Chipembere and his other ministers?",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,PK:,Without a shadow of a doubt I would choose Chipembere. He was our own. And we despised him since Kamuzu had brainwashed us. Today with what I know no ways. These men had good intentions for our country,Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,During this period was your family a member of Malawi Congress Party?,"MCP, Malawi Congress Party",,,
,PK:,"Of course, we were. Remember, we were in one party system and had no alternative. We were born to be MCP (Malawi Congress Party) members.","MCP, Malawi Congress Party",,,
,EM:,"In our last interview, you said that when you came back from South Africa you bought a bicycle. You said the bicycle helped you so much when your child was ill. Describe how this bicycle helped your family?",bicycles,,,
,PK:,"Indeed I bought the bicycle when I came back from South Africa. This bicycle was crucial to my family. As I told you, one night, my child fell ill, I had no other transport means except for the bicycle to take him to the hospital. If it is not for this bicycle, I think my son would have died. There was no way I would have walked to the hospital at night. So this I think, I owe to WNLA. This bicycle was used for many other purposes by the family at home. It was a good companion not only to me but to the whole family.",bicycles,,,
,EM:,"Apart from the bicycle, what other item that you bought that had similar impact in your life?",bicycles,,,
,PK:,"The other item that I bought is Gumba-Gumba, (Big disc radio). This helped me make more money back home. It used to be hired for parties, weddings, birthdays etc. So that also added value to my journey to South Africa.",radios,,,
,EM:,Who was operating this Gumba-Gumba?,radios,,,
,PK:,It was always me who operated it. I didn’t want anyone else to do it as most didn’t know how to.,radios,,,
,EM:,Wow this is good stories of post WNLA. What position was the child you took to the hospital at night? What sex?,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,He was second born,"bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,How old was he then?,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,He was seven years then.,"bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,Would you still remember as when this incident took place?,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,"It was on the 6th August, after 6pm though. And my bicycle had a blue light. This helped me to cycle at night.","bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,"With blue light, that would have been expensive bicycle?","bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,Oh! Yes it was expensive. Not many people would have afforded this. In my case I bought it around K110 (one hundred and ten kwacha),"bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,Wow that’s expensive. That was when 2dollars was equal to one kwacha?,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,"True, kwacha was then too strong for the dollar","bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,Describe the weather like when you were taking your son to the hospital,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,"It was after 6pm, the weather was hot, and you know the weather in our summer like. ","bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,What was he suffering from? What did the doctors say?,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,"The doctors said he was suffering from Malaria, very unbearable. I had to travel with him alone. My wife would not have joined me then","bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,So what hospital did you go then?,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,I took him to Mangochi Central Hospital. That was the biggest and closest,"bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,"If you didn’t have this 3 speeder bicycle, how would you have taken your son to the hospital?","bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,"My wife would have carried him at my back. Really unthinkable, not so?","bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,Oh really? And would you have escorted her? How old was he?,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,"I would escort them, He was seven years old.","bicycles, children",,,
,EM:,So now we can appreciate the role the bicycle played in your family?,"bicycles, children",,,
,PK:,"Indeed it helped me so much. It is for this reasons I thank God for this WNLA contract that I did not only managed to get wife, married her, got a bicycle and gumbagumba which all helped me to earn a living with my family. I owe this to WNLA.","bicycles, radios",,,
,EM:,By chance would have a picture of the bicycle or gumbagumba?,,,,
,PK:,No I don’t have any currently.,,,,
,EM:,"Ok, in 1974 after plane crash, Kamuzu decided to halt the contracts with WNLA. How did this affect you personally?",1974 plane crash,,,
,PK:,"Oh! I was deeply affected. I thought I would go again and work hard to raise funding for my business. But I was left hapless, confused. Look at my letter for me to go back at the same mine.",1974 plane crash,,,
,EM:,So this letter reintroduces you to the same mine and same position?,1974 plane crash,,,
,PK:,"Yes it was to inform the mine managers that am back, and can retain me to the same position in the mine.",1974 plane crash,,,
,EM:,"So when you heard about the termination of the WNLA contracts, you should be devastated?",1974 plane crash,,,
,PK:,"I was devastated, I was so certain that I was coming back here to work and make extra money. I had unfinished business. I know that I did get married but I wanted to raise more funds for my family and business. Unfortunately it wasn’t meant to be.",1974 plane crash,,,
,EM:,"Looking at the document here, it shows that you wanted to go again 1986? Explain that?",1974 plane crash,,,
,PK:,"Yes when WNLA closed, there came TEBA and had similar processes, and similar requirements. But I did not go.","TEBA, The Employment Bureau of Afria",,,
,EM:,Where do you get this document? Would you mind explaining what it meant?,documentation,,,
,PK:,"This document even doing WNLA we were getting it, when going to South Africa, we would leave behind with Malawi government. They would give us a different one to go and present it to the managers at the mine. This document meant that we are fit to work in the mine. Similarly, on our way back we would get similar document from the mine authority reiterating that we have left while fit.",documentation,,,
,EM:,Is that so?,documentation,,,
,PK:,"With this document, the TA and labour office would not restrict or fail you to go. They know you are fit and can travel back to South. You meet all the requirements. This document (permit) was gotten from the court, also confirming that you do not have any criminal record to bar you from going to work with WNLA.",documentation,,,
,EM:,"What if you failed and deemed not fit by the court, or labor office? Were there other means of beating the trap?",documentation,,,
,PK:,"Eeeh there were no other way. No corruption then. They feared that if they let you go while not fit, you were going to fail at the mines. That would have damaged the image of Malawi. There were so many questions and tests along the way, so if you failed at home, you would never succeed further",documentation,,,
,EM:,Oh okay. So did you know your wife or did your parents arrange for you a wife based on their knowledge of the girl or her family?,marriage,,,
,PK:,I did find her myself. It was purely my choice not of my parents. I then introduced her to my family; they welcomed her into our family. There was no such a thing of searching your son for a wife.,marriage,,,
,EM:,Is that so!,marriage,,,
,PK:,"Yes. There was no Facebook then. No zooming at all. Today, with Facebook women look good on the pictures but a disaster when you finally meet her in person. You need personal contact for sure before any stance. Some on Facebook pose as young people when they are very old in real life. This was not the case with our old women. They did not need some application, makeups whatsoever to attract us men. They were real and loyal to us men. Most of them were very realistic and show of natural beauty.",marriage,,,
,EM:,How did you meet your wife?,marriage,,,
,PK:,"I actually, met my wife when playing my Gumba-Gumba show. Remember I was being hired to perform at various occasions. So she was dancing to the songs I was playing at a function. She stole my heart with her dancing antics. I immediately approached her and we clicked. I introduced her to my family and she was welcomed into our family. She is my wife.","marriage, radios",,,
,EM:,"Wow! That’s a wonderful story. so you married her, and you have seven children together. Where are these children?","marriage, children",,,
,PK:,"Yes, they are seven in total. Some are here and others are in South Africa.",children,,,
,EM:,How many are in South Africa?,children,,,
,PK:,There are four in South Africa. Two are boys and two are girls.,children,,,
,EM:,The girl went there after marriage or before getting married?,children,,,
,PK:,They left before getting married. It is not good for women to go there already married.,children,,,
,EM:,Why is it so?,children,,,
,PK:,It is better to go there before marriage that way their marriage lasts unlike if they leave their husbands behind. So they got married there.,children,,,
,EM:,Are they married to South Africans or Malawians? If Malawians from which part?,children,,,
,PK:,"They are married to Malawians. And their men also come from this district, Mangochi.",children,,,
,EM:,And those left behind what are they doing?,children,,,
,PK:,They are also married. They are two girls and one boy.,children,,,
,EM:,"I think you profited from your trip to South Africa under WNLA? You achieved your objective, built a strong family, and your kids also emulated your steel to take up jobs abroad (emigration). You remain strong. ",,,,
,PK:,"Yes I have profited from it. It is a pity it was cut short. If only I managed to go there twice, I would certainly have profited more.",,,,
,EM:,I think I have finally finished asking you my questions I prepared for you. If you have any comment please do so.,,,,
,PK:,"I hope I have answered all the questions. But if you want I can comment on the compensation issue. WNLA without shadow of a doubt has profited me immensely. It has transformed me and my family. But am worried and disappointed that up to now, WNLA, is failing to compensate us, as earlier suggested. We need that money to make us truly feel appreciated for the work we did so well. We made them huge sums of money.",bonuses,,,
,EM:,"I think this is an economic injustice; they need to reward you for many reasons. You have unpaid bonuses, this compensation program would really help you. By the way, are you in touch with other colleagues that you worked with from other countries such Mozambique, Zimbabwe or Botswana? Have they received their bonuses or compensation?",bonuses,,,
,PK:,So far I never heard from any of them. We are not in touch by the way.,bonuses,,,
,EM:,"That’s sad. I hope this issue will be solved soon. Just in passing, a friend who is a priest working with ILO in Johannesburg, told me he was working on the issue of compensation for the Mozambicans who worked in the mines during WNLA. He was looking for lawyers who would assist with the compensation process. He was worried Mozambicans did not come forward for their money. Then I asked about Malawians who are also pushing for this compensation. He told me that Malawians are very slow in submitting key documents for consideration. In your opinion, where did things get stuck?",bonuses,,,
,PK:,Is that so? We did submit our documents long time ago. We don’t know where exactly things got stuck.,bonuses,,,
,EM:,Could it be that your organization is slow in processing such required documents?,bonuses,,,
,PK:,I don’t think so. But government officials do not act fast.,bonuses,,,
,EM:,But why?,bonuses,,,
,PK:,"Probably, they are jealous they can’t embezzle such money. No room for corruption as it is straight from South Africa. So they don’t give attention to this.",bonuses,,,
,EM:,"Very sad. Well, I wish you all the best with the process. It shall be well soon. I look forward to hearing that you received your compensation, and that you feel great that you are appreciated by WNLA.",bonuses,,,

,AG:,"Malawians or Mabwidi, Obwera, [separate terms for foreigners, when asked what Mabwidi meant, she said she didn’t know exactly] ",discrimination,,,
,AG:,"This used to hurt me a lot when we were called these names. The “tsankho” [?]. Let’s say you are given a place to live and you made it look nicer than it was before, then the MaShona would come and tell you to leave, tell you that it is not a place for Mablantyre.",discrimination;housing,,,

,LP:,Who did you used to chat/socialise with?,social life,,,
,AG:,"There were so many Malawians that you don’t even know that you are away from Malawi. I even thought that all Malawians had moved there because we used to stay among so many of them. There are so many Malawians who have a mother from Zimbabwe or South Africa and a father who was Malawian. I used to spend my time with those people. And when you heard that someone’s father was from Malawi you could even stay in that person’s house as if they were your relative. There weren’t any problems there we used to love one another. We, the children used to feel upset by the name calling but it didn’t seem to affect our parents.    ",social life,,,

,LP:,"Did you used to have organisations for people working or living together, or any trade unions?",Tumbuka Burial Society,,,
,AG:,"Yes, the organisations were there. Some of them were for everyone but there were some specifically for Malawians. The ones that I knew of were the burial societies. These organisations were started by Malawians. Because they were not originally from there, they did not have the villages or places to go for funerals and burials, so that is why they came up with the societies. It was very much the Malawians who came up with these. They used to collect money weekly or monthly as a contribution towards these societies, so they could buy food and coffins for the burial ceremony. The Shona later joined these societies because they were impressed by the unity among the Malawians. ",Tumbuka Burial Society,,,
,LP:,"Did you have churches specifically for Malawians? ",CCAP,,,
,AG:,"The churches were not selective, they were not meant for one group or another, but when the Shona saw that Malawians were patronising one church over another, they would brand it a Church of Mablantyre, most of the Shona wouldn’t go there. If you saw a Shona go to that church, maybe if it was a woman she would be following her husband, but Shona didn’t usually go to such churches. ",CCAP,,,

,AG:,"We used to participate, because they wanted more votes. ",,,,
,LP:,"So, you think they allowed people to participate purely to increase their support base or were they able to take positions within parties?",,,,
,AG:,"The President of a party would not mind, everyone was considered able to take part, but if it wasn’t for the leaders and those in the higher positions Malawians would have been chased back a long time ago.",,,,
,LP:,Did you participate in any meetings when Zimbabwe was obtaining independence?,,,,
,AG:,Because we were living in Gwibi Colllege and it was a government building we were not allowed to attend the meetings.

,LP:,So how were you welcomed on your arrival back home?,returning home,,,

,LP:,How did you feel on arrival and how long did it take you to get used to the new environment?,returning home,,,
,AG:,"When I came here, I felt as if I was coming home. In Zimbabwe we used to be called Mablantyre so I was never really happy there. I was prepared for what I was going to face when I came back, that is why I have never really found it difficult to stay here. I just had the heart to come home, even if I had to come here and eat greens (bonongwe) I was happier than staying in Zimbabwe where the food was good because I was tired of all the name calling, “Mablantyre”… people used to tell me that because I was stout that when I came to Malawi I would lose weight because the food wasn’t good, but I didn’t really care. And then when people used to tell me that I would tell them it was fine, that I would eat whatever was found in Malawi.",returning home;food,,,

,LP:,"What made you marry a Malawian man? What were the differences between Malawian men and those form Zimbabwe? ",marriage,,,
,AG:,My mother is Angoni from Mwanza and because of the attitude of the Shona it would not have been a good idea for us to marry Shona men. We grew up with the mentality that we would marry somebody form Malawi.,marriage,,,

,AG:,"Yes, all of us married Malawian men. ",marriage,,,

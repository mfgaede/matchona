,EM,"Once again today I would like to chat with you two. First, introduce yourselves please",mangochi,,,
,TS,My name? I am Tambuli Samson,,,,
,EM,"Oh! Tambuli Samson, not Stambuli?",,,,
,TS,"No, am Tambuli Samson",,,,
,EM,"Wow! These are English names. So, when did you travel?",,,,
,TS,I travelled in 1972.,1970s,,,
,EM,Oh ok 1972 and back in 1974?,1970s,,,
,TS,Yes,1970s,,,
,EM,How many journeys did you make?,1970s,,,
,TS,Only once,1970s,,,
,EM,"Ok. How about you, Sir?",1970s,,,
,MC,I am McDonald Chiwaya Usi.,1970s,,,
,EM,"So, when did you travel?",1970s,,,
,MC,"Actually, I travelled the same year 1972 but I came back early 1975 because the contract was curtailed and they were busy transporting miners back home, so my turn only came early 1975","1974 plane crash ",,,
,EM,"Wow! So, do you stayed a year without working while waiting for transport to go back home?","1974 plane crash ",,,
,MC,Not year rather a month.,"1974 plane crash ",,,
,EM,"Oh, I see. Do you have any picture or it an item from South Africa with you?",,,,
,MC,"Ohm I don’t have any, they were destroyed. But what I can remember is my coin number which here we call company number. This is what identifies you. When someone reads it, knows this is Chiwaya and nobody else.",documentation,,,
,EM,"That’s interesting. So, do you still remember this coin number? ",documentation,,,
,MC,"Yes, I do",documentation,,,
,EM,What is it?,documentation,,,
,MC,519952,documentation,,,
,EM,"Oh ok, that Chiwawa? Fantastic. So both of you left for South Africa in 1972? That’s when they were about to end the contract in 1975. What happened that they had to end the contract?","1974 plane crash ",,,
,MC,Aaah the rumours we got was that the train fell and that forced Dr. Kamuzu Banda to request that his people come home immediately.,"1974 plane crash ",,,
,EM,"Is that so? So, it was a train not a plane?","1974 plane crash ",,,
,MC,"Yes. I don’t know my colleague what he has to say? As for it was the train. I don’t know what they did to it, hence it developed a fault.","1974 plane crash ",,,
,EM,Where did this take place? In Mozambique or another country?,"1974 plane crash ",,,
,MC,Rumours had it that it happened in Mozambique. I don’t know what my friend has to say.,"1974 plane crash ",,,
,TS,Similar story,"1974 plane crash ",,,
,MC,We just heard that the train fell in Mozambique and many workers got injured and that forced Dr. Kamuzu Banda to recall his workers back home. Like me I travelled through the train when going to South Africa but had to use a plane when coming back.,"1974 plane crash ",,,
,EM,In the 1975s there was a civil war with intense fighting in Mozambique. Could it be that guerrillas decided to bomb the train? Or the President felt insecure to have his men continue using Mozambican channel through the train? Just my thinking.,"1974 plane crash ",,,
,MC,"Could be the reason, and that’s why the president decided to hire Air Malawi to come pick us from South Africa and never to use the train again.","1974 plane crash ",,,
,EM,"Now, what motivated you to leave Malawi to South Africa to work in the mines?",poverty,,,
,TS,"I decided to leave because of absolute poverty (umphawi wa mtadzaoneni). Then when you see those miners coming back, you could see how they alleviated their poverty, made me think of going to South Africa too. ",poverty,,,
,EM,How about you?,poverty,,,
,MC,"Like my colleague, me too is poverty. I had just finished Standard 8 (grade 8) and no one could pay for my school fees in secondary school. When you see miners coming back with blankets and money, I was motivated to go to South Africa to do likewise.","school fees,;consumer goods",,,
,EM,"Oh okay, so poverty was the main drive for your travelling to South Africa to work in the mines? But were you married when you were leaving?",family,,,
,TS,I left a wife.,family,,,
,EM,Oh ok. With a child?,family,,,
,TS,No without. She was young,family,,,
,EM,So when you came that’s when you had your first child?,family,,,
,TS,"Yes, immediately when I came back. I could not wait any longer",family,,,
,EM,How about you?,family,,,
,MC,I was not married when I left. I had just finished school. I thought I needed to travel and get some money to start the business and possibly to marry.,capital,,,
,EM,"Oh okay. So when you made this decision, how did your family, wife, parents take it?",family,,,
,TS,In my case all were happy. They saw something new in me and encouraged and supported me throughout. This made me to send my parents the first wage I received to make them happy.,family;remittances,,,
,EM,So where did you leave your wife?,family,,,
,TS,I left her at her parent’s house.,family,,,
,EM,"Oh yes that’s what your culture demands? When you marry, you move to your wife’s side home. And what was her parent’s reaction to your travelling into South Africa and leaving your young wife with them?",family,,,
,TS,They had no worries at all. They knew I would come back,family,,,
,EM,How about you?,family,,,
,MC,"My parents knew what I was doing and supported me. They I wanted to make money to get driving license, and some money for my future wife and children. So, when I came back, ",family;marriage,,,
,MC,"I applied for driving lessons in Blantyre. Unfortunately, I failed twice. Lucky enough, I was employed at the Malawi Hotels, where I worked and got promoted to the Barman. I was very happy then.",capital,,,
,EM,"Oh okay. Thank you so much. Now that you made up your mind to go to work in the mines in South Africa, what was the first step you made?",capital,,,
,TS,"Firstly, we go to get a form from our local group village headman. Then we take the form to the Traditional Authority to get his confirmation, thereafter to the District Commissioner. From there we start getting ready for the journey.",documentation,,,
,EM,What do you mean by getting ready for the journey?,documentation,,,
,TS,We would be going to the DC to check if today would be leaving or not.,documentation,,,
,EM,So you would just be going to the DC office to see if the journey is ready?,documentation,,,
,TS,"Yes, if the journey is ready the luck ones would be picked ",documentation,,,
,EM,Is it true Macdonald?,documentation,,,
,MC,"Very true to what he is saying. After dropping T/A’s confirmation letter at the DC’s office, we would be coming to check when the journey would ready. When they pick you that day, we were driven to Mapanga, Blantyre. ",documentation,,,
,EM,Oh okay.,documentation,,,
,MC,"Yes, at Mapanga, the doctor would come to make several tests, until they are convinced that we are fit to work in the mine. The sick and not fit, were returned home.",medical inspection,,,
,EM,Ok go on.,,,,
,MC,"When all is set, they picked us to the railway station, when they picked us to South Africa. We arrived after seven (7) days. If I have forgotten my brother can add.",,,,
,TS,"Oh, that was the way it was. On the first day, we weighed on a scale, if you don’t reach the right weight, you were not accepted.",medical inspection,,,
,EM,Where was this taking place? At Mapanga or at DC’s Labour Office?,medical inspection,,,
,TS,"This was at Labour Office. Luckily, we passed that test, and those who failed were asked to go eat groundnuts and come back at a later date.",medical inspection,,,
,EM,"Hahahahaha really? Groundnuts? That’s funny. So, they have picked you up from Labour Office and now you are at Mapanga. What was happening there?",medical inspection,,,
,MC,"When you arrive at Mapanga and all is set, we were receiving khaki trousers and blue t-shirt. That marked you are ready for South Africa. They also gave us 10 shillings. That was pocket money on the way. That was a lot. ",medical inspection,,,
,EM,"So, at Mapanga there were no further medical testing? ",medical inspection,,,
,MC,"Oh yes there were. What I said is about when all tests were done, and you passed fit to leave for South Africa. That’s when you get the khaki trousers and blue t-shirt for all miners from Malawi. ",medical inspection;clothing,,,
,EM,"After this then to railway station, off to Mozambique by coal train?",transportation,,,
,MC,"Yes, straight by coal train slowly hahahahha…. Seven (7) days to Joburg (short form for Johannesburg).",transportation,,,
,EM,What happens when you get to Johannesburg?,,,,
,MC,"They received us as newcomers and distributed us to our specific mines. When we got there, they sent us to mine school. There we were taught various things about the mine. Including the language of the mines. After that we were tested, and graded, B1-Very intelligent, B2-Average, B-3 eeeh this one even live wire he would touch. Failed. Not good enough hahahahahahah. From here, we would go down to the mines to get mine etiquette. Not to smoke, to listen to your leader called pass-boy. ",fanakalo,,,
,EM,"Oh, pass boy?",miner,,,
,MC,"Yes, he was the head of the mine. When you are sick you would go to him to report. Him reports to the Mine Manager. That’s it, Sir.",miner;illness,,,
,EM,"So, what language were you speaking when you meet in the mines considering you are Malawians, Mozambicans, and South Africans?",fanakalo,,,
,MC,"Fanakalo. This was a language made after combining different languages Chichewa, Shangani, Zulu, Xhosa etc. This language is only spoken in the mines. This Fanikalo",fanakalo,,,
,EM,How did you manage to speak it?,fanakalo,,,
,MC,"There were books plus those who went ahead of us taught us as well. When they say, buya la, meant come here. This is the language for everyone even if you were Tumbuka, Yawo, Sena, you had to master this language. Let my brother also add his voice on this.",fanakalo,,,
,TS,"Yes, there was not English only Fanikalo. ",fanakalo,,,
,EM,"What about when you are done in the mines, you are free in your compounds, what would you be speaking?",housing;communication,,,
,MC,"When free and in our hostels, we could speak our country local languages……Chichewa, Yao etc.",housing;communication,,,
,EM,"Tell me, were put into hostels according to your nationality?",housing;communication,,,
,MC,"Yes, we were allocated per country of origin. Shangani’s, Malawians, and others separately. And we had in each country’s hostel leaders and police to bring peace.",Shangaan people,,,
,EM,Oh okay. What about izibonda?,housing,,,
,TS,"Izibonda is the chief in the house. A leader. ",housing,,,
,EM,Is that so?,housing,,,
,TS,"For sure and I was the police of the house. If someone goes against the house etiquette, I was reporting him to Izibonda. Even if he spills water on the floor and if he refuses to clean the floor, I would report him straight to Izibonda, and he would act swiftly.",housing,,,
,EM,"That was nice and orderly. So, in the mines you spoke fanikalo while in the hostels you spoke your local language. So, on your free time, were you able to read newspapers, watch TVs or cinema, or listen to the radio?",,,,
,MC,"When we knocked off, we would go into the shower where we bathed from the dust in the mines. From there we would go to our hostels to get changed. Get our plates and rations to the kitchen to get food. After that we could be play games, watch football and any leisure activities of choice. Even we had a bar where we could go get some beers.",entertainment;alcohol,,,
,EM,Were these beers free for all?,alcohol,,,
,MC,"Only weekends we could get some free beers, maheu (sweet beer), even nqomboti (African beers, brewed locally). But any other times, we could buy those beers (cash). If I forgot anything, my friend could remind me.",alcohol,,,
,TS,That’s exactly it. It was all similar,alcohol,,,
,EM,Were you all in the same mine?,alcohol,,,
,TS,"No, different ones.",,,,
,EM,But the experience is the same?,,,,
,TS,"Yes, very similar.",,,,
,EM,"Great. So, so the point of contact with other people from other countries was in the mines alone?",,,,
,MC,"Yes, in the mines also in the leisure halls, including at the bar. There we could only communicate through fanikalo. We were very friendly no hatred or tensions.",communication,,,
,EM,"In the mines, you were placed on different levels based on your ability as assessed by the management. Where were you placed?",miner,,,
,TS,I was placed on level 1.,miner,,,
,EM,"So, what were you doing at level 1?",miner,,,
,TS,"I was bell boy. But at first, I was the shovel boy. After several months, I was the best shovel boy. I could do 20 shovels while others 13 per hour. Hence the boss promoted me to bell boy. I spent most of my time there receiving and sending information when the lift arrives and leaves. So, I could be idle for two hours waiting for the lift of stones. I enjoyed working there as was not as hard as the previous shovel boy position.",miner,,,
,EM,"Oh, good and how about there?",miner,,,
,MC,"I was first placed as Malaisha. I only worked there for few months. Then due to my school and good English, the boss promoted me to a lamp boy. As a lamp boy I was minding the lamp house. This is the house where lamps were stored. After few months I was again promoted to a lamp clerk. I was responsible for all the lamps in the mine. I need to take note of all the lamps in the house and those taken out on each day. If one miner does not pick up his lamp, I needed to find out why? I then had to report to the manager. I really enjoyed working as clerk. It was a high rank position and with good pay too. This was job. Due to my school, I could also get overtime work to add to my pay.",miner;clerk,,,
,EM,"While working in the mines, how was your security?",,,,
,MC,"There was great security for everyone. That was very important ",,,,
,EM,"How was your relationships? Would you have special relationships with workers of other countries? ",,,,
,TS,"Yes, we could relate to any person despite his nationality. Like I used to mix a lot with the Shanganis from Mozambique. They called me crazy guy because I could easily join and fit in any group of people.",Shangaan people,,,
,EM,"I can imagine there were only male voices in the mine. Were there any female miners? ",dating,,,
,TS,Ohmm there were no women in the mines. We could only see women when we go outside the mines.,dating,,,
,EM,"Oh, you could go out? When?",dating,,,
,TS,"Yes, we could go out on Saturdays and Sundays. We could go out on these days provided we respected the working days.",dating,,,
,EM,And could you have relationships outside with women?,dating,,,
,TS,"Yes, it was possible.",dating,,,
,EM,Did you get a girlfriend outside?,dating,,,
,TS,"Me? No, I did not. Throughout my tenure, I did not have any girlfriend. I was afraid.",dating,,,
,MC,"I was also afraid as there were stories that most guys who had sexual relationships outside, were coming without their manhood, and other complications. We were very afraid.",sex;dating,,,
,MC,"To add again on what my brother has said, I used to visit some of my friends from Malawi in the neighbouring mines. I could go there, welcomed by them after showing ID number. I could also sleep over with no problem. Them they could do likewise.",friends;social life,,,
,EM,How about with Malawians who had settled in the areas outside the mine? Could you interact with them?,friends;social life,,,
,TS,"Yes, we could interact with them. Sometimes they could let us know of parties, even funerals in their communities. And we could attend if possible.",friends;social life,,,
,EM,"Say the funeral is communicated, and burial is on Wednesday, a working day. Would you request permission to attend?",friends;social life,,,
,TS,"No. It was obvious that the management of the mine would not give us the permission. We attended only if the burials were on weekends, free day.",friends;social life,,,
,EM,What about strikes? Were there such conflicts and strikes in the mines?,strikes/labour protests,,,
,MC,"Very rare. When they happened, we used to police who would report to the compound manager. If he also failed to control, he would call outside police to come to calm down the situation.  But this happened seldomly. We had a very good working relationship with each other.",strikes/labour protests,,,
,EM,Who would mostly start these violent actions?,discrimination,,,
,MC,"Mostly the locals, South Africans. They did not like us because we were hard workers and preferrable to the mine managers.",discrimination,,,
,TS,"The locals started all these and would call us, “ma nyasa inu, amphawi.” You, Malawians, are very poor that’s why you are here. Yet are all working in the mines to earn a living hahahahaha. “You need to come here by long train trips, to earn a living. We only go home and back within a week unlike you.” That’s how they used to mock us. They felt jealous of how we were treated by mine managers simply because we were hard workers.",discrimination,,,
,EM,That’s a good story. But were you afraid to lose your job? Or termination of your contract?,housing;absenteeism,,,
,MC,"Oh no. There were not chasing you unless extreme cases. Otherwise, they wanted you to finish your full term, 24 months of contract. There was so much work and needed more people. So we weren’t that afraid.",housing;absenteeism,,,
,EM,Would you decide to leave the mines and seek other piece jobs outside the mines?,housing;absenteeism,,,
,MC,"Ohmmm other workers would decide to do that, but when found, they would arrest you and bring back to your designated mine. It was really very rare as the mine managers made sure we had really good food and treatment, so why would you decide to walk out?",housing;absenteeism,,,
,EM,"So, they really took care of you. How about your hostels? Were they that clean?",housing,,,
,MC,"Oh yes very clean. We used to sleep like in secondary schools. One bed down and another on top. They really took care of us. We had good food, each had his own plate, cup and utensils. ",housing,,,
,EM,"So, it was no longer necessary to run away for other jobs outside?",housing,,,
,TS,Aaah no need as everything was smoothly run. No complaints. They took care of us,housing,,,
,MC,"Also, they used to pay us on time without delays or jumping a month without pay.",Islam,,,
,EM,"What about your religious matters? Were you given off so to attend the prayers on specific days, Saturdays, Sundays, or Fridays?",Islam,,,
,TS,"Yes, it was possible. Those on Friday we could go to mosques, those on Saturdays or Sundays could go and attend.",Islam,,,
,EM,My impression is that you were well taken care of. And the managers liked Malawians?,strikes/labour protests,,,
,MC,"Yes, they liked us and favoured us because we were hard workers. Well disciplined, respected the rules. They preferred to work with Malawians than other nations. Unlike Malawians the other nations especially the locals, would only manage a contract of six (6) months and off the go. Twenty-four (24) months was too much to the locals. So, Malawians were most trusted workers. When Malawian miner was given a hard work, was working diligently without unwillingness, revolt, as the locals would do. This attitude made Malawians loved more.",strikes/labour protests,,,
,EM,It is commonly said that there was too much dust in the mines which was hazardous to human health. Was that not an issue in your mines? Were there some incidents of TB and other diseases?,strikes/labour protests,,,
,MC,"In my case, my mine was a very clean mine, that diseases were not easily detected. The pass boys were very strict that you would not litter in the mines. As I said, after knocking off they made sure we go into shower to clean ourselves from the dust. This helped to clean ourselves from such diseases. ",illness,,,
,TS,On top of that every six months we were taken for medical check ups in case we contracted diseases. This was to establish if you contracted some diseases in the mine the last six months.,illness,,,
,EM,What if they find you with the disease that you contracted in the last six months? Would they help you?,illness,,,
,TS,"Yes, they would assist you. We had clinics within the mine. However, if the disease persists, they would send you home. But sometimes, if you are still strong, they would remove you from the mines that you do light works outside the mines. ",illness,,,
,EM,"So, would the pay remain the same?",illness,,,
,TS,No. outside the mine you earned less than those who worked in the mines,illness,,,
,EM,"Let me take you back. When processing your application from Labour office and at the departure centers, would at times pay some kickbacks to the officials so that they process your application with favour?",corruption,,,
,TS & MC,"No ways, those days there was no corruption at all. ",corruption,,,
,EM,"Oh okay. Let us go to personal question, how much were you earning?",wages,,,
,TS,"I remember. I used to receive 55 cents per day. That was a very good money. I earned that because I was in mine far away, at Barberton, near Swaziland.",wages,,,
,MC,Very good pay indeed. That was 1 to 1 with Malawi Kwacha. I was at Sheba Mine,wages,,,
,EM,Oh ok. So how much were getting?,wages,,,
,MC,"I started with 45cents, and I finished with 75cents per day. This is due to overtime and level of my education.",wages,,,
,EM,"Tell me, was this money received all or some was deducted?",remittances,,,
,MC,"It was deducted in phases. First salary was deducted to refund government money for transportation. Second and third months’ salary was given in full that we manage to buy some useful stuff. The fourth month salary was deducted to the saving account back home, the remainder was given to me. I think it was the same with my brother here.",remittances,,,
,EM,"Oh, so the first you reimburse government of Malawi’s contribution to your transport. Second and third months’ salary was given to you that you settle, and the fourth month that’s when they deducted into two, to your savings account back home and your upkeep.",remittances,,,
,MC,That’s it. I don’t know if it was similar with my fellow brother.,remittances,,,
,TS,"Yes, similar situation.",remittances,,,
,EM,"Oh okay, that was a good program then. Am I wrong to conclude that you used to remit to Malawi the change you received monthly in the mine?",remittances,,,
,TS & MC,"Yes, that was it.",remittances,,,
,EM,"So, you were not taking from the account back home?",remittances,,,
,MC,"No, it was untampered that account. We could only access it when we came back. Upon arrival that’s when we were able to take hold of the account itself.",remittances,,,
,EM,Was that account opened before you left?,remittances,,,
,TS,Those accounts were opened by the government when you had already left.,remittances,,,
,MC,"And each account was linked with your ID in the mine. So, when you went back home, you could find you have an account like your employment number",remittances,,,
,EM,Could the government interfere with your account?,remittances,,,
,MC,No. It was given to you and had freedom to collect all cash or take a bit and leave everything.,remittances,,,
,EM,So did you buy something from South Africa?,purchases,,,
,MC,"Yes. We bought shoes, blankets, t-shirts, and other items like watch, and music systems.",purchases,,,
,EM,Were you sharing the stuff you brought with you to your relatives?,purchases,,,
,MC,"Yes, we had to be sharing different stuff. You wanted to show others that I am coming from abroad",purchases,,,
,EM,So what did you do with your money?,purchases,,,
,TS,"When I came back home, I brought bicycles, clothes, radio. When I came back, I also bought cows, goats and built a house. I also paid fees for my sister as that that I did not have children.",purchases,,,
,EM,About you?,purchases,,,
,MC,"Me, I used my money to partly register for driving school, which unfortunately, I failed. But that was one of the reasons to go to South Africa.",purchases,,,
,EM,How long did it take you to access your money when you arrived home?,remittances,,,
,MC,"Immediately. We came by plane, and when we arrived in Blantyre, they gave us our account books",remittances,,,
,EM,"The period you went to South Africa, it was an apartheid era, did that affect you?",apartheid,,,
,MC,"No it didn’t affect us. Only the locals were the ones being affected. Some of us were only there concentrating on our job. ",apartheid,,,
,EM,Even the police did not harass you?,apartheid,,,
,TS,Aaah no. We never experienced any police harshness.,apartheid,,,
,EM,"Earlier on I asked why you were motivated to leave for South Africa, now I want you answer as to why you decided to come back home? Especially that you are not married and with not really responsibilities back home.",returning home,,,
,MC,"I was motivated because I wanted to go to access my savings account. I wanted to start learning how to drive, start business and get married",returning home,,,
,TS,"In addition, they kept our passports. So even if you wanted to hang on, it wouldn’t work as your passport was held by the mine administrators. They would only give you when you are leaving to go back home.",returning home,,,
,EM,In your case (Tambuli Samson) I thought you were motivated to go back home to see your wife?,returning home,,,
,TS,"Yes, but not really. I wanted to go get my money and start a new life. Also wanted people to see me that I am back.",returning home,,,
,EM,Tell me about the story around the bonus? Is every miner who went to South Africa is to receive this bonus? Are you entitled to?,bonuses,,,
,TS,"Yes, I am. All ex-miners are entitled.",bonuses,,,
,EM,So why is it that it is taking long?,bonuses,,,
,TS,"It could be our government officials here. They are playing with us, many of us have died without getting their bonuses.",bonuses,,,
,EM,"So, who is at fault? Is it our government or South African government?",bonuses,,,
,TS,I think it is Malawian government. They are not explaining to us clearly why it is taking long.,bonuses,,,
,EM,"Now, you came back home this time by air Malawi. How were your welcomed back in the society by your family?",returning home,,,
,TS,"They welcomed us. ",returning home,,,
,MC,"In my case my parents were relieved that I came back home healthily as there were many stories about mines falling and people dying in the mines. So, they were excited that I came back alive. They threw a party, killed chicken with rice.",returning home,,,
,EM,"Well, am done with my questions. However, if you have some questions for me, please your time.",returning home,,,
,TS,Please if you can help us receive our bonuses would be great.,bonuses,,,
,MC,I want to agree with my brother here. We are being laughed at by many people who think we are not going to be paid anything. Please assist us that we get something,bonuses,,,
,EM,"Isn’t it pathetic to note that a sovereign government wants to pay back bonuses to ex-miners and the home country sits without any interest. I thought, a straight government would welcome that considering its own people are going to be assisted, it is going to bring huge sums of forex, etc.",bonuses,,,
,EM,"Now, you both travelled to South Africa in 1972 and came back in 1974?",bonuses,,,
,TS & MC,"Yes, that’s when we went to South Africa and back. We indeed profited with that experience. We bought things like blankets, clothes, bicycles, watches, and radios.",bonuses,,,
,EM,"Well, if you don’t not have anything to ask me, this would mark the end of our interview.",bonuses,,,
,MC,May be my friend has something to ask.,bonuses,,,
,TS,"I do not have anything to add, but I just ask Allah to make sure all goes well, and we get our bonuses and get a relief of pain in our lives.",bonuses,,,
,EM,"I again have two or three questions; one is who calculates the amount of bonus one receives? Malawi government or South African government? Or even the mines themselves? How do they know this individual is alive or dead? These are just my questions, and you don’t have to answer me.",bonuses,,,
,EM,"I am just asking myself.  Or is that the authorities have settled for a general figure say MK500,000 for a every ex-miner?",bonuses,,,
,EM,"Further, does this bonus/compensation meant for TEBA (1980s)&or WNLA (1939-1975) ex-miners or for both? If you know and want to answer me, please feel free to do so.",bonuses,,,
,EM,"If you don’t have, I will try to find out from other authorities from labour offices. I pray that this issue ends well, and people are all served. The rightful miners are served with their bonuses.",bonuses,,,
,EM,"Finally, I want to thank you for your time and sharing with us your information. As I asked earlier, I want to ask for your consent to get this information used electronically or on books.",,,,
,TS,"Welcome as well, we thank you for your interest on us. We hope one day this book will be read by our grandchildren. Published our own names, without any reservation.",,,,
,EM,Thank you. See you again on 22nd May 2022 when my colleague joins us here for a group meeting.,,,,

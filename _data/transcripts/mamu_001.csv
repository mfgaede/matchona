,Elias P.K. Mandala (EM),"Here am chatting with Mr. Matumula Mamu. He was born in 1950. He travelled first in 1971 to 1973 under WNLA. Thereafter he travelled under TEBA till in 1988. Wow, basically he has been there since 1971 to 1988. So, tell me, what it was like after 2 years of your contract. Were you renewing while in South Africa?",1970s;1980s,,,,
,Matumula Mamu (MM),"No, we used to renew when we came back by doing the same things we used to do, all the processes. They gave us a month to renew our contract back home.",,,,,
,EM,Is that so? Was that with WNLA and Theba?,WNLA;TEBA ,,,,
,MM,Both WNA and Teba had similar processes. They gave us one month of a rest before we went back to the mines.,TEBA,,,,
,EM,"ok let me take the pictures of the document you have so far.So, in 1971, what drove you to South Africa?",,,,,
,MM,The journey was driven by huge levels of poverty within my family.,poverty,,,,
,EM,Can you explain or expound more?,,,,,
,MM," Well, you see, I was not educated and then I was growing up. I needed to go to South Africa to make sure I can make some money to take care my family.",,,,,
,EM,"Oh okay. So, what was the general process for you to obtain the contract and thereafter you travel to South Africa?",,,,,
,MM,"First we were going to register interest to go to WNLA at Labour Office. There they used to send to our Traditional Authority, Mpondasi. The T/A was to sign and stamp our forms. Thereafter, we were going back to the Labour Office. At labour office, they used to measure our height, weight. Then, they were sending us to Ngumbe, in Blantyre.",vetting;documentation,,,,
,EM,Ngumbi in Blantyre?,documentation;medical inspection;Traditional Authorities,,,,

,EM,"So, after one week at Ngumbe, and all vaccines done, where were you going next?",medical inspection,,,,
,MM,We were heading to Mzilikazi.,transportation,,,,
,EM,"Oh, Mzilikazi in South Africa?",transportation,,,,
,MM,Yes.,transportation,,,,
,EM,what was the mode of transport?,transportation,,,,
,MM,We were flying. By airplane straight to Botswana,transportation,,,,
,EM,"So, you were flying?",transportation,,,,
,MM,"Yes. Under WNLA we flew to Botswana and there we connected with train to Johannesburg. While under Teba, we flew direct to South Africa. ",transportation,,,,
,EM,"Wow! That was good. So, you left Malawi, to Botswana, then to Mzilikazi in South Africa, how were they welcoming you? What happened later?",transportation,,,,
,MM,"They gave us first class welcome. They gave us food, accommodation and thereafter, seeing the doctor for health examinations. Then, they would allocate you the mine to work",medical inspection,,,,
,EM,"Oh, so while leaving Malawi, you did not know what mine you are going to be working on?",contract,,,,
,MM,"No, we didn’t know. But while at Mzilikazi, you were allocated one",contract,,,,
,EM,"Now that you arrived at the allocated mine, were they putting you into a house or dormitory?",housing,,,,

,EM,"Oh, just like in a hostel?",housing,,,,
,MM,"Yes, yes.",housing,,,,
,EM,What about food? Were you cooking for yourselves?,food,,,,
,MM,"Actually, they cooked for us. The food was very good, in good amounts. Even if you felt not enough you could go and receive extra food.",food,,,,
,EM,"Oh, really? That’s good.",food,,,,
,MM,They really took a good care of us. We had no problem with them at all,medical inspection,,,,
,EM,"That’s good to know. So, you are now at the designated mine, what was the first thing that you were introduced to?",medical inspection,,,,
,MM,"We were first introduced to the doctor to check whether we are sick or not. In case the doctors back home (Malawi) lied about my health. So, it was like three doctors in the process. At Ngumbe back in Blantyre, at Mzilikazi and at the mine itself.",medical inspection,,,,
,EM,"So, doctor’s tests what next?",fanakalo,,,,
,MM,"They would send us to the school mine. There we were introduced to the mine language, called, Fanakalo.",fanakalo,,,,
,EM,"Oh okay. So, they were very organized. Very procedural.",fanakalo,,,,
,MM,Yes. This language helped us communicate to each other in the mines,fanakalo,,,,
,EM,"So, how long would that course take?",fanakalo,,,,
,MM,It took a week,fanakalo,,,,
,EM,"So, in a week, you would really know the language?",fanakalo,,,,
,MM,"Not really. The issue is, after a week they assumed we have the basic language principle and the rest we would learn while in the mines. That was good and helpful.",fanakalo,,,,
,EM,"So, you are back in the mine. Ready for the work. What was the next step?",fanakalo,,,,
,MM,Shosholoza.,vetting;medical inspection,,,,
,EM,What was that?,vetting;medical inspection,,,,
,MM,That was the fitness. You were noticed and placed on a number depending on your physique,vetting;medical inspection,,,,
,EM,"Oh, physical exercise?",vetting;medical inspection,,,,
,MM,"Yes. The doctors would give your energy booster tablets, panados, etc. This process helped them locate on work platform. If you are too strong you could be assigned deep inside the mines, and the weak ones would not be allowed work inside rather they were given easy work outside the mines",vetting;medical inspection,,,,
,EM,"So, the exercise was safe the weak from the strong and putting them in their respect positions in the mines?",vetting;medical inspection,,,,
,MM,"Yes. This is the last exercise. Thereafter, you are now starting your work in the mine. Loafing time is ever.",vetting;medical inspection,,,,
,EM,"Taking you back, before you decided to come to South Africa, did you have a relation in the mines anywhere in South Africa?",,,,,
,MM,"No, I knew no one. I just decided to come over and make money for my family too.",,,,,
,EM,Is that so?,,,,,
,MM,Yes Sir. All Malawians were posted to different mines at Mzilikazi.,,,,,
,EM,"When you decided to leave for South Africa to work in mines, how did your family take it? Did they accept it?",family,,,,
,MM,"Yes, they did welcome the idea and had no issue. They knew if I leave, I was going to change my life",family,,,,
,EM,"So, was there a time you wanted to get these paper works at labor office where you had to bribe the officers?",corruption,,,,
,MM,"No ways, there was no need. Unlike today, then there was no corruption. Officers would report you to the authority",corruption,,,,
,EM,"Wow! There was clean business all round. So, after the Shosholoza (exercise) where were you placed, inside or outside?",miner,,,,
,MM,I was placed deep inside. We took lifts and inside we also took a train to arrive at the position I was placed. It was dark and we used headlamps,miner,,,,
,EM,Wow! Really deep. Did you enjoy your work?,miner,,,,
,MM,I had too as I did not have any choice.,miner,,,,
,EM,"So, while deep down the mines, what was your experience?",miner,,,,

,EM,Tell me when you arrived at your mine. Did you meet someone from Malawi that you knew?,,,,,
,MM,"Oh yes, I met a few people that I knew from my area.",,,,,
,EM,Were there some relatives?,,,,,

,MM,"We used Fanakalo, the one we learnt at the mine school when we arrived.",fanakalo,,,,
,EM,Oh yes! Fanakalo.,fanakalo,,,,
,MM,"Yes, all people from Angola, Congo, Malawi, Mozambique we communicated through fanakalo.",fanakalo;Angolan people,,,,
,EM,"What was your relationship with workers of other nations, mentioned above?",social life,,,,
,MM,"We had great relationship. The managers used to bring us together in the hall, to explain to us that we need to be united, we are one people with one goal. Hence, they encouraged us to be united and work together.",social life;Angolan people,,,,
,EM,"Wow! That was nice. While working in the mine, was there a time you felt like giving up on your contract and think of walking outside and seek new job opportunities due to bad working conditions, hard work in the mines, sickness and or low income?",absenteeism,,,,
,MM,"When you got sick, they called for an ambulance for you to get medical attention at the hospital.",illness,,,,

,EM,"So, while working in the mines, were you ever get visitors from Malawi Government?",Malawi Labour Representative ,,,,

,EM,"So, you never thought of running away from your contract?",absenteeism,,,,
,MM,"Not at all. You see, some weekends, a fortnight, they would give us off on Saturdays. And the other weekend, I would work but at night.  On some off days, I would walk out and work in the nearest gardens and farms of the white farmers.",farm labourer,,,,
,EM,Oh yeah! To add up some income?,farm labourer,,,,
,MM,Yes.,farm labourer,,,,
,EM,You went to South Africa before you married right?,marriage,,,,
,MM,Yes. I only married when I came back from the first trip.,marriage,,,,
,EM,"So, while in the mines or on your part time moment, did you manage to have a girlfriend there?",sex,,,,
,MM,"No ways. We were really looked after. They checked on us and you would not dare have a girlfriend. Also, they warned us that if we get sexual diseases, we will be responsible for ourselves not the company. The company is sorely responsible if we get diseases while in the mine. So, we were very careful and minding our work.",sex,,,,
,EM,But while in the mines weren’t you drinking beers and other beverages?,sex,,,,
,MM,"Of course, we had a hall and bar. So, beers were served in the hall for those who could drink were able to do so. And we could have dances. Women dancers could come in the hall to entertain us. But no casual women could walk in the mines, no ways. Only dancing women",sex,,,,

,MM,No woman worker in the mines. It was men’s show only.,sex,,,,
,EM,Wow! And what are iziboda?,housing,,,,
,MM,"Oh, these are designated house or hostel leaders. His bed would be near the door. If something goes wrong in the house, we will report to him. He would solve the issue. He would bring peace amongst us. But if the dispute gets heated, he then reports it to the site manager (white).",housing,,,,
,EM,"Oh, I see, so Iziboda reports to the site manager?",housing,,,,
,MM,"Yes. The manager would bring peace to the dispute. The police would also check our hostels constantly looking for knives and other metals that can be used during conflicts. If we buy stuffs like knives, we used to keep them elsewhere the police won’t be able to see them",housing,,,,
,EM,"How about issues of homosexuality? Like men sleeping with other men, since you were only men in the mines.",homosexuality,,,,
,MM,"Ohm I never heard of that. Maybe it was happening in the other hostels of other nations. But in Malawian hostels there was nothing of such nature. We were all as one family, chatting and sharing things.",homosexuality,,,,
,EM,"If things did not, please you in the mine, were you able to make strikes?",strikes/labour protests,,,,
,MM,Ohm not from Malawians. It was popular with South Africans; they could strike not us (Malawians).,strikes/labour protests,,,,
,EM,What were the main issues for the strikes?,strikes/labour protests,,,,
,MM,"Mostly were about salary increases. They felt they were being paid peanuts. After the increment, the issue is resolved",strikes/labour protests;wages,,,,
,EM,But was the wage increment affecting everyone in the mine or just those who prostrated? (South Africans),strikes/labour protests;wages,,,,

,EM,What about movies?,radios,,,,
,MM,Only radios no movies,radios,,,,
,EM,Were you at any time worried about being fired etc?,strikes/labour protests,,,,
,MM,"Not really. We were well protected. And if we find that we are being abused by the white managers, we were given offices where we could report the abuse within the mine.",strikes/labour protests,,,,
,EM,"So, what happens when you reported them?",strikes/labour protests,,,,
,MM,The abusers were called to explain why they are abusing workers. This is a human right body. Most often this manager would be shifted to another site,strikes/labour protests,,,,
,EM,Were there a time when some workers were suffering TB and other airborne diseases?,tuberculosis,,,,
,MM,"Oh yes, many suffered from TB due to the dust in the mines.",tuberculosis,,,,
,EM,How about you?,tuberculosis,,,,
,MM,"Yes, I did though when I came back home but not within the mines",tuberculosis,,,,
,EM,What was the company doing to the TB patient?,tuberculosis,,,,
,MM,"They were taken care of by the company. Instead, after being healed, these workers were no longer accepted inside the mine, but were given other duties outside the mine.",tuberculosis,,,,
,EM,"Tell me if you don’t mind the amount of money, your salary per day or monthly?",,,,,

,EM,"Were you able to go to churches, mosques to worship God?",Islam,,,,
,MM,"Oh, yes, we had the freedom to do that. I used to go to the mosque on Fridays; those of Saturdays, and Sundays would also do the same. I was the driver and first aider. Like in the mine, when someone got injured, I was called upon to offer first aid services.",Islam,,,,
,EM,"Wow! So, were you getting an increment for doing such services?",Islam,,,,
,MM,"Oh yes, I was receiving something extra.",Islam,,,,
,,[He insisted that I see the documents that showed his role as first aider],,,,,

,MM,"A small chunk of it was given while there, and some here when we arrived back from South Africa.",bonuses,,,,
,EM,"Oh, so all the moneys you received while in South Africa and others here. That’s nice to hear. I see your books here. Oh, let me see this letter. From whom?",letters,,,,
,MM,[laughs] From my wife.,letters,,,,
,,"[NB: This letter is attached to his folder. She wrote to him telling him she will remain hopeful that when he comes back home, they will marry and form a family. Somewhere around 1971 during his first trip (contract).and when he returned in 1972, they got married, and still together, 2022.]",letters,,,,
,EM,"So, explain again how the money issue was shared by WNLA to you while in South Africa and Malawi?",remittances,,,,
,MM,"Ok, in South Africa they cut half of the whole sum of my monthly wage. The other some was deposited straight into my savings account back in Malawi. That money I used to get it when I came back in Malawi at Ngumbe before going back to my home.",remittances,,,,

,EM,"The period you were working in South Africa, it was the era of the White Regime. And apartheid was high, did it affect you?",apartheid,,,,
,MM,"Not at all. We knew that white is ruling and heard of the backlash, but never affected me.",apartheid,,,,
,EM,"How about inside the mine? Were there pockets or elements of apartheid, xenophobia amongst the white managers and black Africans labourers?",apartheid,,,,
,MM,"Oh, no ways. They were very good to us foreigners. So, I would be doing justice or being honest to say I experienced apartheid. Even when we went outside the mine, we had tags and numbers. When we met police, they knew we were mine workers and have nothing to do with what was happening in their communities",apartheid,,,,
,EM,"Am now done with my questions. But before I end, let me summarize. You left first under WNLA in 1971 up to 1973, then you went again in 1974 to 1975?",,,,,
,MM,"Exactly, however, when the plane crashed, I was still in South Africa, working in the mine. The news reached us that a plane from Malawi with mine workers crashed.",1974 plane crash ,,,,

,EM:,"So, do you remember when you first to South Africa to work in the WNLA mine?",,,,

,Group:,[laughs],,,,

,JW:,"Oh ok, great. You can go on asking them why they really left their homes, their comfort zones to work in the mines in South Africa.",,,,
,EM:,"Oh, okay let me do that. I already heard from my friends, those we met previously on what motivated you to leave home for south Africa to work in the mines? Most of you cited poverty to be the main reason for your flight to South Africa. How about the new members? Can you also tell me your reasons?",,,,
,Chitani Sane Amidu:,"Like me, I was driven by poverty at my parents’ home. So, seeing friends going and coming from working in the mines in South Africa, I felt like doing the same. They changed the face of their families. I wanted to do the same. Although, the money was not that good, but still changed our families in different ways.",poverty;family,,,
,EM:,"Apart from the poverty itself, there should be something unique that motivated you to go to South Africa?",,,,

,EM:,Any other wants to add as to what really motivated you to leave Malawi to go work in the mines in South Africa.,,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"Let me add my voice to this, Sir.",,,,
,EM:,Go ahead.,,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"In my case, I was first lured by my friends who came back with loads of stuffs. They managed to build houses for themselves etc. I was indeed motivated by that. I thought I was going to do the same. ",friends,,,
,EM:,How did it turn out to be if you don’t mind?,,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"Actually, when I came back, I did manage to bring clothes and blankets for my family. Their faces were lit by what I brought them. They felt it that our son was really coming from abroad. Unfortunately, WNLA stopped before I built a house for myself or for my family. Apart from this, I still managed to give my family a new lease of life. If only I managed to go twice or thrice to South Africa, I could really have changed the face of my family and village. With that spirit of working hard, I then went to Blantyre and found work at Kamuzu’s house (Sanjika State House). I worked for two years there.",family;purchases;Sanjika State House,,,
,EM:,Oooh really? And you worked as what?,,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,I worked as garden boy,Sanjika State House,,,
,EM:,Wow! That was something else.,,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"Yes, in 1976 to 1977. We were hundreds of people lined up at Sanjika State Residence for interviews. Only ten of us were picked. ",Sanjika State House,,,
,EM:,"So, what made you stand out?",,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"Oh well, we were asked questions of where we come from, what work we did before, our criminal records, if we paid our taxes, and political party cards (MCP).",Sanjika State House,,,
,EM:,Did you not tell them about your mine (WNLA) experience?,,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"Yes, I did and that made them believe the hard worker in me. Probably that’s why they hired me. I was employed on 26thMarch 1976 and left in 1977, the time of the uprising on Muwalo. [One of the political figures, a former faithful who later challenged Dr, Kamuzu Banda. He was hanged to death]",Sanjika State House;Albert Muwalo,,,
,EM:,"Oh okay, good to know. So basically, you were attracted by what your peers brought back home.",,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"Exactly, they brought with them Wilson hats, bicycles, blankets, beautiful clothes, attires, radios (Gumba gumba). So, I felt compelled to go to. And went there, worked for two years, without any accident, though worked deep down the mine.",purchases;bicycles;radio;clothing,,,
,EM:,Thanks for sharing. How about you Mr. Edward Lokote?,,,,
,Edward Lokote:,"Similar story. When you see those who came back from working in the mines, I felt called to also go and do the same. I was attracted by the big luggage they brought, bicycles, blankets, strange clothes, radios, and some built good houses. I felt I am not a man enough if I didn’t go and do like what others did. So, I admired the others.",purchases;bicycles;radios;clothing,,,
,EM:,"So, you mean to say bicycle was a prestigious item around here, in your villages in those days?",bicycles,,,
,Edward Lokote:,"Oh yes! Oh yes bicycle was something else. Especially those sporty with gears. We would line up to see those cycling them with great admiration. That alone could drive you to aspire to go to South Africa to work in the mines even when we used to hear of terrifying stories. ",bicycles,,,
,EM:,So that bicycle aspect drove you mad besides poverty?,bicycles,,,
,Edward Lokote:,"Exactly, Sir. ",bicycles,,,
,EM:,"Tell me, were you bringing these six geared sporty bicycles from South Africa?",bicycles,,,
,Edward Lokote:,"No, we were buying them here, in Blantyre. (Group answered the same). When we arrived in Blantyre from South Africa, the Asian traders knew of our coming and we would need to buy the bicycles. So, they were there ready for purchase. They were selling at K28 (28 Kwacha). That’s hummer type of bicycles and others were K14 (14 Kwacha). Also, those bicycles we would sell them back home at K14 during famine.",bicycles;famine,,,
,EM:,Oh! You could sell them during famine time that you buy food?,bicycles;famine,,,
,Edward Lokote:,Yes.,bicycles;famine,,,
,EM:,"So, what exact thing that motivated you to leave your parents to go to work in the mines?",,,,
,Edward Lokote:,"When I dropped out of school due to our poverty of my family, I decided that I work so hard to let my brothers manage to go to school. So, the only option to get the fees was for me to go to work in the mines in South Africa. ",education;poverty;family,,,
,EM:,"So, did you manage to achieve this goal?",,,,
,Edward Lokote:,"Yes. I did manage to get my brother attend schools which I did not manage to finish. I knew when they finish school, they will be able to take care of themselves and others in the family. So, I feel I achieved my goal of going to work in the mines.",education;family,,,
,EM:,Anyone who wants to share?,,,,
,Useni Afiki:,Can also share?,,,,
,EM:,Go ahead please.,,,,
,Useni Afiki:,"In my case, it was the poverty at home. Hence, I decided to migrate that I manage to get some money that can assist my family come out of poverty. I knew I needed to get good money that when I come home, I could also buy cows, land to build houses for rentals.",poverty;entrepreneurship,,,
,EM:,"So, you were not lured by radios (gumba gumba), flashy bicycles, blankets (Tchale), etc.?",purchases;bicycles;radios,,,
,Useni Afiki:,"Not really, though they did motivate, but on a lesser level as compared to the issues I mentioned above. So, I thank God that I did manage to go to WNLA and brought the things I wanted. To me that was very successful. But that money that I brought was slowly finishing as many relatives looked up to me, as the only well to do person. ",purchases;family,,,
,EM:,Is that so?,,,,
,Useni Afiki:,"Yes, and I had to look for a cooking job from a well to do person, Mr. Lalabi, who had a farm within Mangochi.",Mangochi,,,
,EM:,Was Mr. Lalabi a white man or local?,Mangochi,,,
,Useni Afiki:,"Yes, he was Greek. I worked there for several years, till had my wife, children while there. When I decided to leave, I went back home and opened a garden, where I am till today. that’s my story.",Mangochi;marriage;children,,,
,EM:,"Thank you so much, Sir. Is there anyone who wants to add to the reasons for your going to South Africa? My old team can chip if you feel so.",,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"Yes, let add my voice. The first thing that led most of us to go to South Africa is none other than extreme poverty. The government had no other incentives or alternatives. This was the main reason.",poverty,,,
,EM:,"Oh ok, go on secondly?",,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,The second reason is that we were lured by those returnees. What they were bringing home is what attracted us.,purchases,,,
,EM:,"Alright, like what?",,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"Like what my friends previously mentioned. Like bicycles, blankets (Tchale- very thick and heavy blankets, very fashionable in the 70s), radios (chigumbagumba-big radios that play using records, very popular amongst the returnees in 80s). Having said that, personally, I was driven by the desire to get money so that when I come back home, I can marry. Remember, I went to South Africa while I was very young, fresh from school, and had nothing to show off to my wife to be. So, I left for South Africa, worked, kept my money, and when I came back, I married my wife. After marriage, first year I was blessed with a child. I used the same money from WNLA to send him to school. So, most of my children went to school using the same money.",purchases;bicycles;radios;marriage;children;education,,,
,EM:,"Going back to the property especially bicycle, what meaning did it have amongst the young and old men in the 70s?",bicycles,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"Bicycle had special duty at home. It brought development, transporting stuffs plus when the children are ill, we could use it to take them to the hospital. So, bicycle was just for fashion, or show off, but it was the main household transport. Very reliable too.",bicycles;children,,,
,EM:,Oh! Thanks for sharing. Anyone willing to say something?,,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"Yes, I want to add to what others have already said. So basically, poverty was the main issue, and the attractiveness of the men who returned from South Africa. However, what really drove me was this, that when I come back, I get to marry my sweetheart. I wanted to have a beautiful wedding because I would have enough money to achieve this goal. Secondly, when I come back, I will have enough money to build my own beautiful house to live with my new family. A beautiful home for all the equipment that others have already mention above. I didn’t want that such expensive equipment to be kept outside or kept at someone’s home, no, but well kept within my own house. About the bicycle…",poverty;marriage;children;purchases,,,
,EM:,"So, you too bought a bicycle?",bicycles,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"Yes, and a portable radio, good shoes, jean trousers. I did not buy Gumbagumba (big radio). So, I managed to build a house, and married with seven (7) children. Three (3) died and I remained with four (4) children. These four, I sent them all to school. And now I sit down and thank WNLA to have profited me.",bicycles;radio;purchases;children;education,,,
,EM:,I think I have exhausted this question. We can move to the next question.,,,,
,JW:,"Ask about their clothing before and after they came back. Were they able to buy hats, boots…?",clothing,,,
,EM:,"Good one. We understand that before you left for South Africa you were in absolute poverty, and now that you went and came back home what was your clothing fashion or attire? What kind of clothing did you bring with you back home? This question is open to everyone. Any takers?",clothing,,,
,Group:,"We came back very changed as we brought new clothes, trending clothes like shoes called JT (pronounced as Jon Tee-very sharp pointed shoes), more like cowboy boots.",clothing,,,
,JW:,Why Jon Tee (cowboy shoes?),clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"This was the trending shoes. Most young men used to wear that as fashion. So, when we arrived back home, girls knew that we truly came back from abroad, WNLA boys. ",clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"We also used to wear flair pair of trousers, combined with Wilson hat.",clothing,,,
,EM:,What kind of hat?,clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,Wilson hat. With ties,clothing,,,
,EM:,What kind of ties? Short or long and big?,clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,Short ones. We looked like a gentleman from South Africa,clothing,,,
,Group:,[laughs],,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"So, we bought suits.",clothing,,,
,JW:,Why you bought suits?,clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,Ambition. This indicated that this is the retired man from South Africa,clothing,,,
,EM:,"Anyone who wants to add on this attire question? You have told us about JT boots, ties, suits.",clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"We brought many different clothes. Some brought suits, terevira trousers and shirts.",clothing,,,
,EM:,What are terevira?,clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"This could be shirt or trousers, that you could iron today and after a week would never lose its shape. Some called crown fashion",clothing,,,
,EM:,"So, was this in fashion in those days? And in black colour?",clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"Yes, that was a mark of fashionable men from South Africa. Oh, it had to be in black colours",clothing,,,
,EM:,"So, both shirt and trousers had to be black? And of terevira fashion?",clothing,,,
,"Unclear Respondent, different:","Yes. Shirt could be of any colours, but perfect man had to be both black. It was nice, and people admired us unlike these days.",clothing,,,
,"Unclear Respondent, different:",Belly bottom were also in fashion.,clothing,,,
,EM:,"Oh, belly bottom? What was that?",clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"These are trousers with flair touch down there. Simply called flair trousers. Were very popular among us, returnees.",clothing,,,
,JW:,"Oh, those with open bottoms. Oh yes, my dad had those too, bell bottoms.",clothing,,,
,EM:,"Anyone else? If not, let’s talk about the hats. Were you imitating South Africans or what you watched in the movies?",clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"No, we saw the local South Africans wearing. So were enticed to buy and showbiz in the streets back home.",clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"Actually, we would buy them in South Africa, but bring them home. We would dress up only when we arrived in Malawi at Ngumbe before we left for our respective homes. This was to differentiate with the local men who never went to WNLA. The clothing alone would identify us as true men who just arrived from South Africa.",clothing;Ngumbe,,,
,JW:,So how was the Wilson hat look like?,clothing,,,
,EM:,Wilson hat looked very close to cowboy’s hat. Round top with a beautiful feather on the ring.,clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"We also had safari suit. Which also made us look very special, and unique.",clothing,,,
,EM:,How does it look like? Describe please,clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"It is a short-sleeved shirt, with buttons from top down. It has four pockets two on each side of the shirt, one up and one down, with cuts on both sides. Both, trousers, and shirt must be of the same colour. And you do not tuck in the shirt.",clothing,,,
,JW:,"So, you would bring with you the safari suit?",clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,Yes,clothing,,,
,EM:,"So, it was in fashion in South Africa as well?",clothing,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,Yes.,clothing,,,
,JW:,"So, how did you feel when you came back home and dressing in those attires?",clothing,,,
,Group:,"Oh! We did feel great, something like showbiz, and to some extent we were creating envy in those who were watching us. Some started hating us while others were lured by this and aspired to also go to South Africa.",clothing;purchases,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"Like me, when I woke up in the morning people knew that this guy is from South Africa due to the clothes I was wearing, plus the skin changed, was soft and good looking unlike my friends who are at home. You did not have to tell them that I am from South Africa. Even without a bicycle, just mere clothes would tell that this person is from South Africa.",clothing;bicycles,,,
,EM:,"So, the showbiz really attracted many young men to start the process of going to work for WNLA as well. Now, for some of you who went to WNLA while married and with kids, and those who went for the second time after getting married with children. What I want to know is the kind of relationship you had with your wife and children while away.",marriage;children,,,
,Chitani Sane Amidu:,"When we arrived at our workplace, we always tried to keep in touch with our families and kids back home. And the little that we get, we tried to send back home to make sure they lack anything. When, a child gets sick, we could send something that will take the child to the hospital. That way, we created good relationship with our family back home. They were not feeling neglected at all.",children;family,,,
,EM:,How did they feel seeing you back home in that showbiz kind of arrival?,,,,
,Chitani Sane Amidu:,"Actually, they felt great. They had great expectations from their dad. Hence, in my case, I used to bring clothes for my wife, my children that they too dressed like their friends in South Africa. When they walk outside the house, people should really feel that their father or husband has arrived from South Africa",family;clothing;marriage;children,,,
,EM:,"Oh, this is great story. Anyone else?",,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"Like I used to send money every two months to my wife that she should not lack anything. However, I was disappointed to note that she was also dating another man. She was not satisfied with my support. So, when I came back, I told her that I wouldn’t want to compete for one woman. I had to leave her. If I had stayed with her, I would have died as she attempted to poison me once, thank God I vomited and survived. That I had to let her go. The good news is that I managed to take care of my children. ",marriage;poverty;children;divorce,,,
,EM:,"So, this separation didn’t affect your kids?",children;marriage;divorce,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"No, this separation did not affect them at all. Now they are grown up and with their own families too.",children;marriage;family;divorce,,,
,EM:,"So, did you marry again?",marriage,,,
,Kaliza Bazilio:,"Yes, I did marry again and was blessed with 7 children, 4 alive and 3 passed on. All of them have their own families and children. So, I have a full village here.",marriage;children,,,
,EM:,Anyone else who wants to contribute?,,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"In my case, I lost my wife and remained with my kids. So, remarried another woman. I told her to take care of my 2 kids. As I speak, I now have 28 grandchildren. When I get home, am surrounded by my grandchildren and even forgetting their names. So, my wife really took a really good care of my children. Now, I am a happy man, having been in marriage for 48 years.",marriage;children;family,,,
,EM:,"So, this means you were a supporting husband even while away?",marriage,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"Definitely, I was so supportive. Every two months I used to send money to her that she takes care of our children, that way my wife was not worried at all. She could count on me. She knew that all the help is coming because of the kids she is minding. ",marriage;children,,,
,EM:,"Very interesting. Now, I see someone else trying to give us his account. Your name again, Sir.",,,,
,Matumula Mamu:,"Matumula Mamu. Firstly, when I came first from South Africa, I bought cows, I built a house. My children went to school but only one finished school, up to form 4. The second child didn’t finish school as when I was robbed of the cows, I was left with nothing to assist them with fees. So, the second one left while in form 3. When my wife died, I decided not to marry so that I could take care of the kids. So, I am really in deep poverty. Some came back from their marriages; others lost their husbands.",purchases;education;marriage;children;poverty;family,,,
,EM:,"So, you mean one of your children stole your herd of cows?",,,,
,Matumula Mamu:,"No, not my children but robbers. They paralyzed my family development.",children;poverty,,,
,Useni Afiki:,"In my case, I was married but without a child when I left first for South Africa. But when I came back were blessed with four children. And after that, my wife became so abused to me. [You may wish to note that this is the case in the matrimonial marriages/tribes. Women have so many powers over their husbands since men are housed within their wives’ households.] So, I was forced to leave her and marry another woman. But I was very happy to take care of my children. They are now grown-ups. Big boys now. But their mother is still alive and with another man. ",marriage;children;divorce,,,
,EM:,"So, can we conclude that these children love you because you did take a good care of them while in South Africa and back home?",children,,,
,Useni Afiki:,Definitely. I really made feel proud of me knowing that their mom and I are separated and that I was there for them.,marriage;children;divorce,,,
,EM:,Are you married again?,marriage,,,
,Useni Afiki:,"Oh, sure am married again. So, children from the first and second marriage are happy that am taking a good care of them. They are all happy and am proud of them.",marriage;children,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"The reason for me to go to South Africa was that later I can take care of my children. I achieved that most of them have gone to school. They are happy that I was able to send them to school. They know that their dad is loving, he went abroad for their sake.",children;education,,,
,EM:,This means that the WNLA trip made progress in your life?,,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"Very much so. Imagine all my children have gone to school. Now one is a nurse, teacher, driver, and a manager. They all studied through the WNLA money. All the money I used to keep paid off.",children;education,,,
,EM:,"Oh, good to hear that. So, next, you are the son of the examiner. Talk to us about your experience, as a recipient.",,,,
,Mmadi Masudi:,Mmadi Masudi. Thanks. I am indeed a son of an examiner. I am the deputy secretary of MAM (Miners Association of Malawi).,Miners Association of Malawi,,,
,EM:,Good one. Now tell us about your experience that you were home while your dad was in South Africa. What was your experience?,,,,
,Mmadi Masudi,"Am going to talk as a child just as I experienced it. We had a very good relationship with our dad. He was very supportive to the family especially us children, sending us money regularly to pay school fees, food and upkeep. When he was coming back home, we were very excited as he brought us toys, chocolate, bicycles, groceries etc. we had high expectations. ",family;children;education;purchases;bicycles,,,
,EM:,How was the communication like with your dad while he was away?,communication,,,
,Mmadi Masudi,"We used to communicate through his friends especially those who were coming back home. They used to tell us how dad was doing and when we would expect his return. Also, sometimes over the weekends, he would call us or his relatives also in South Africa would call us through the phones.",communication;family,,,
,EM:,"Oh, so you had ground phone?",communication,,,
,Mmadi Masudi,"Yes, we had ground phone in the house. We used to hear and sometimes he would call to tell us how he was. So, communication was very easy.",communication,,,
,EM:,"Thank you for your experience. Now that you are back home, showbizzing with the stuff that you brought back from WNLA, how did you feel about those boys, girls, your peers who admired the way you looked? Secondly, those peers who never travelled to South Africa, how were they perceived by the people in the villages?",purchases;returning home,,,
,Useni Afiki:,"Say if their kids came to our homes, we were treating them just like our kids. If ours were drinking tea, we could also give them, no segregation.",returning home,,,
,EM:,"Oh ok, but I mean your peers?",returning home,,,
,Useni Afiki:,"They obvious feeling bad, they were admiring us. But we would also assist them with blankets if they didn’t have. If they were at our home with our kids, we would help them same way we did with our kids. ",children;returning home,,,
,EM:,"Oh, okay. How about others?",returning home,,,
,Tambuli Samson:,"The story of WNLA was a proud story so to speak especially when you have come back healthier, fit. When we came back and with that pomp, we definitely used to look down upon our peers who never travelled to South Africa. We forgot all the hardships in the mines. That was also a mark of new life.

,Tambuli Samson:,Those whom we found back home were viewed as failures and not real men. They could not go abroad as well. Weak men. They were also undermined and not regarded as strong men.,returning home,,,
,EM:,Any other to contribute?,returning home,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"Honestly those who did not travel were taken as cowards. They were afraid of the mines, thinking they would die in the mines. But some of us were strong willed and took the risk and had this belief that if we die, the money will benefit our families and parents. ",returning home;family,,,
,EM:,"Now that you are back healthier, good looking, fitter etc., how did your parents feel?",returning home;family,,,
,Matumula Mamu:,"They felt very good. They looked at us with great happiness as they thought we would die while in the mines. This was according to the romours that people get accidents, lose body parts etc. while in the mines.",returning home,,,

,EM:,"Yes, go ahead.",returning home,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"We saw those of our peers who never went to WNLA as cowards, we looked down upon them. Them too, felt like we are pompous and arrogant. They knew that we are now richer than them. A bit part of it was jealous on their part. We took them as lazy people who didn’t wan to do hard work.",returning home,,,
,EM:,"How about the parents of those who refused their children to travel to South Africa to work in mines, especially that you are now back home alive, without scars of injuries, accidents, with property (gumbagumba, bicycles, and blankets), how did they feel about you?",returning home;purchases;bicycles,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"They felt very low, and full of jealous. Almost telling you don’t pass through this road with your sport 3 speeder bicycle. They felt we are too proud, pompous with our riches unlike their children they refused to go to work in WNLA.",returning home;bicycles,,,

,Matumula Mamu:,"Our coming back was driven by the main objective of the journey…. which was to go to work to raise enough money to start families, businesses, support parents and children fees.

This was always the case, homesickness never left us.",returning home;entrepreneurship;family;education;children,,,

,Alabi Mitawa:,"When we left for South Africa, we had an agenda…...poverty. Some we left without shoes, without a trouser, we first wore a pair trouser in Blantyre on our way to South Africa. They dressed us well before leaving. Some short guys wearing long trousers and tall guys wearing short trousers. We never had watches though they gave us some wrist straps, not watches before leaving, these were numbers for everyone for identification. That was your number and name.",returning home;poverty;clothing,,,
,EM:,You were given right here in Blantyre?,,,,
[01:08:57],Alabi Mitawa:,"Yes. Though when we arrived in the mines, they were giving us another number different from this one. So, when I was in South Africa i always remembered that I left a wife and parents. So, each time, I used to send some money to my mother, and my wife. After two months without sending her some money, say K20, that would mean I was no longer interested in her. So, I used to send her at least K400 after months. That was really good money then. This and the vibe that people should see me that Alabi has come back and is cycling a good sporty bicycle, was always driving me to come back home. Even some people used to call us Chapagalu.",remittances;family;marriage;bicycles;chapagalu,,,
,EM:,What did Chapagalu mean?,chapagalu,,,
,Alabi Mitawa:,"This meant that, you went to South Africa as a dog, who has no eyes to see. But when you will come back as dog that has eyes open. We went as poor and we come back as someone who has eyes open able to dress up, cycle bicycles, own a big radio, well civilized as compared to the time we first left. So, we were called Chapa-galu. (Chapa means-wash; Galu means-dog). Despite being called such names, we were not demoralized. Like me I went three journeys starting from 1964. The boy the one I was sending to school, is the one who is dressing me up now. Look how I look. These are not clothes from South Africa. He went to school and now does business and feeds his family and looks after me. The benefit of WNLA.",chapagalu;education;children;clothing;family;returning home,,,
,EM:,Anyone?,,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"Anyone who went to South Africa then, had an objective to achieve. In my case, I went to WNLA sorely to raise funds for my wedding. It is for that reason that I had to come back to marry my promised sweetheart. There was no point of staying behind as mtchona ( an emigrant who settles away from home). Honestly, those who called us Mchapagalu, were right as we left home for South Africa as not as civilized as we came back. We were cleaned, sharpened by the experience we got in the mines while in South Africa. Most people in this district, Fort Johnstone now Mangochi went to South Africa, and this developed the district. If WNLA and TEBA continued, would have developed the district so much as compared to other districts who had less men going to WNLA or TEBA. That is what I wanted to add to this.",marriage;chapagalu;Teba;Fort Johnstone;Mangochi,,,
,EM:,"Thanks, Mr. Kumbemba. Who else wants to add up?",,,,
,Beston Makhuva Fred:,In my I left so as to uplift poverty in my family. This drive helped me from being busy with women while in South Africa. I know many people were embroidered with sexual activities and seeking safe heaven in South Africa. But I was focusing on what I went there for. I didn’t go there to get rich per se but to earn a good living for myself and my family not to run away from my family.,family;poverty,,,
,EM:,"Is that so? Fine. Now that you were there in the mines, had different names. What names were you calling yourselves?",,,,

,Unclear Respondent:,"You see, were not working alone as Malawians. We worked with different people from different countries and cultures. We worked with Tswanas, Shanganis, and others. We could not sing our own songs as that would break the unity we had. However, we could sing a common song in fanakalou that everyone in the mine understood.

,EM:,Like what songs?,songs,,,
,Group:,"They liked Chilala ma poisa, chilala ma poisa.",,,,
,EM:,What did that mean?,,,,
,Alabi Mitawa:,"It means in the mines we had men having sex with other men. So, when we see a police officer giving a gift to a man, we knew they were homosexuals (mathanyula). These are police within the mines. They had so many powers and could easily force to sleep with you. So, each time we saw that happening we sang such song.",homosexuality;songs,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"Also on Sundays, we had social events where each country showcased their traditional dances. As from Malawi, we had Chongolo by Achewa from Lilongwe.

This was only men’s entertainment.",dances;chongolo,,,
,EM:,"So, you meant chongolo was a Malawian dance?",dances;chongolo,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"Not really. Chongolo was a mine school test, where we were tested blood strength. It was too hot in the mines, ranging from 30 to 40 degrees Celsius high. So not all men could get inside that. Hence, we had to be tested chongolo, blood test, to measure if you can to what levels in the mine. Like, me, I passed all levels hence I could work at any levels in the mines. Others could only go as far as second level due to their blood test.",medicine;health;chongolo,,,
,Alabi Mitawa:,"True, we were tested on the scale from morning to 12pm. Others could fall on the scale. It wasn’t an easy process. That process was called chongolo. Even the white men were also tested so measure how far they can go. Checking their energy levels.",medicine;health,,,

,EM:,"So, what happened if you failed?",medicine;health,,,
,Alabi Mitawa:,"Actually, they had to give you energy injection. A very painful injection, they were injecting on your chest near the heart. After three days, you were gaining a lot of energy. We were receiving this injection 3times in 24 months, twice in 18 months. ",medicine;health,,,
,EM:,What was the name of this injection?,medicine;health,,,

,Pearson Kumbemba:,"All day. Started in the morning till evening. Some ingoma, nyau, were also being showcased by Malawians. We got the materials right there",dances,,,
,EM:,How did that affect you?,,,,

,Group:,"Yes, especially after the traditional dances, we had soccer matches. Country versus country.",football,,,
,EM:,"Wow! Was Malawi winning? ",football,,,
,Group:,"Yes, we used to win and at times we could lose. We also used to play mine against mine during those social weekends. And we only had men as spectators without women supporters.",football,,,
,EM:,"So, did you have something in common with other miners from other countries?",,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"Yes, especially the Shanganis, we had similar things even culturally. A bit different from other countries like Angola, Lesotho, etc.",Shangaan people;Angolan people;Sotho people,,,

,EM:,"Now I am interested to know especially the dangers you may have encountered while prior to leaving for South Africa at Mapanga. You were being weighed on scale, tested, and even injected with different vaccines.  Firstly, were you weighed while naked or with clothes? And who was carrying such tests?",dangers;health;medicine,,,
,Group:,"Were weighed while naked in front of a white doctor from Thyolo hospital. [Thyolo is district next to Blantyre. This doctor would be coming from the tea and coffee estates clinics.

,Ngumbalo Harry:,"Testing us while naked was not right to be honest. It was sad and regrettable, unfortunately we had less power as we wanted to fight our own poverty.",medicine,,,
,EM:,"Did they request for your consent? Or inform you of the procedure? ",medicine,,,
[01:31:55],Ngumbalo Harry:,"No ways. We were only asked to take off our clothes and go straight to the scale. They were even touching us, our private parts, without respect. ",medicine,,,
,EM:,Was this done at Mapanga?,medicine;Mapanga,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"Yes, this was at Mapanga. They were not even classifying us men from young men. All were naked before each other.

,EM:,"And, you did not have chance to complain these acts?",medicine,,,
,Group:," No. We were swallowing our pride and respect so that we get access to the contract with WNLA",medicine,,,
,Beston Makhuva Fred:,TEBA was different. We were even tested by a woman. While naked the lady would shake our manhood. This was very inhumane. We are human beings and not less human despite our poverty. This was done at Mzilikazi center in South Africa.,Teba;medicine;Mzilikazi,,,
,EM:,"Oh, with TEBA, this exercise was don’t right in South Africa not at Mapanga as was with WNLA?",Teba;Mapanga,,,

,EM:,How did you take that?,medicine,,,
,Beston Makhuva Fred:,"I had no choice. I was already in South Africa, on site, I could not go back home simply because I didn’t want to be touched by a woman. Plus, I have an agenda I wanted to achieve, ending my poverty. ",medicine,,,
,EM:,"That was bad. Now, what was the main reason for most parents refusing to let their children to go to WNLA?",family,,,
,Group:,"Mostly parents were afraid of death, accidents. They heard many rumours about the dangers in the mines.",family,,,
,EM:,"Now that you were there, experienced it, what would tell those parents?",family,,,

,Useni Afiki:,It was very hard work. Walking a long distance underground. But we were well equipped. Though those clothing attire if it gets worn out you must buy it yourself.

,EM:,"How come when you contracted the disease in the mine, should you go back home?",health,,,
,Group:,"Yes, they wanted a healthy working force. You know in the mine, there is too much dust. So, TB was always the common disease. This was why each morning before any work in the mine, they started watering all angles to control the dust. So, TB and Psychosis (SP) was always the issue. Also, in the mine there was no water.

,EM:,"How about the ex-miners, who happened to be friends, would they share with you some of the dangers of working in the mines?",dangers,,,
,Group:,"No, they would never tell us. Even us did not want to tell anyone aspiring to go to WNLA about the dangers we faced in the mines. We kept it a secret.",dangers,,,
,EM:,Why would you keep it a secret from young men who are eager to go to WNLA?,dangers,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,It was because we did not want them to be afraid and give up from going to WNLA.,dangers,,,
,EM:,Was this an advice from the mine leaders or WNLA?,dangers,,,

,EM:,"Oh, is that so?",,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"This was mostly with Malawians as we were very loyal unlike our colleagues from South Africa who were vocal and could fail to report to work any day they want without any punishment. We were very passionate about our work and passive. During holiday days, we could just remain within the mine. And if we were sick, we could go access treatment but not failing to report to work. ",absenteeism,,,
,EM:,Why would they arrest loyal and hardworking Malawians and take no action against lazy South Africans and other nations? I don’t understand the rationale.,absenteeism,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"The issue is, we Malawians vowed to come to work hard and not to be lazy. So, we made an agreement with our government that we will not embarrass our country. So, not report to work for no good reason, was punished by 14 days imprisonment. ",absenteeism,,,
,"Unclear Respondent, different:","In my case in Impala, RPM, and Burgersfort, they did not arrest us for absenteeism. They instead cut our daily pay. They did not send us to prison.

,EM:,Let us talk about religion. We have our religious affiliations. Tell me how did your religion prepare you for this journey to work in the mine? Did it have any contribution?,religion,,,

,EM:,"While in the mines, how did your faith help you to persevere the hard labour you encountered?",religion,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"Our different faiths really made us strong and persevere all the hardship we encountered daily in the mines. We knew soon we shall be out of this and be ready to live a better life out there. It was a sacrifice to some extent. ",religion,,,
,Ngumbalo Harry:,"Very true. Like some of us Muslims, we had to eat anything that was given to us. Whether it was pork, forbidden fish and other foods we had to eat just to be able to work in the mines. We had to forgo many of the things.",religion,,,
,EM:,Going back to the first set of questions I asked those I talked to last time. Was there vetting done by the chiefs before recommending you to the Traditional Authority?,vetting,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"Yes. They would want to find our if you are of good reputation in the village. If you paid your taxes, political cards, no criminal records etc. then, the chief would recommend you to the TA.",vetting,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,There were some taxes as well that we paid without us knowing. But the government Malawi and of South Africa knew everything about it including their agreements. these taxes were cut while in South Africa already.,taxes,,,
,EM:,"So, you mean while in South Africa, there were some hidden taxes that you were not aware of? ",taxes,,,
,Unclear Respondent:,"Yes. Some of these taxes included, death, funeral, graveyard, coffin taxes. They used to cut us even when you were not aware of. We only realized of these taxes when we came back home.",taxes,,,

,Group:,"They would bury you there. Everything they would do it themselves without anyone. However, they would send the money to the next of kin suggested by you before your death.",taxes,,,
,EM:,Was this done with your consent where you had to sign?,taxes,,,
,Group:,"Not at all. We only realized this when we came back and when you had no powers to demand repayment of all the moneys accrued. But government of Malawi knew of these taxes and cuts.  Furthermore, when you die, they were not according you with your religious death or burial rituals. They were only burying you just like any other person.",taxes;religion,,,
,EM:,"Let us talk about the bonuses. I want to understand them. You told me that when your contract came to an end, they gave you a bonus book with an agreement that within six month you must report back to WNLA for you to avail for your bonuses. Failing which, you may not receive the total sum value of your bonuses. Is that correct?",bonuses,,,
,Group:,"Yes, that was the agreement.",bonuses,,,
,EM:,"Now, may those who have travelled more than once respond to this question.  Were you given the money inscribed in your bonus books upon reporting back within the six months?",bonuses,,,
[02:12:30],Ngumbalo Harry:,"In my case, when I reported back, I was not given money, rather I was indebted to start at the position I was working on in the previous contract. That was the bonus for me. If you were a timber boy, you resume work as a timber boy. In the mine, I was work on, it was not money per se for reporting early.  However, if you reported after 6 months, you were to restart with mine school process rather than going straight to the work you had in the previous contract. 132:30 Also, bonus meant that when you come will have the same salary/wage amount. But if you take more than 6 months, you will be changed the work category plus different wage. That’s what bonus was meant for. ",bonuses,,,
,Alabi Mitawa:,"As for me, at the end of my contract, they gave me the bonus book with an explanation that when I come back within the prescribed months (6), they would pay all the bonus benefits. Unfortunately, I did not make it back due to the WNLA closure in 1975. So, in my opinion, my money is still in South Africa.",bonuses,,,
,Pearson Kumbemba:,"Same with me, however, they had told me when I come back within 12months not six as others. ",bonuses,,,

,EM:,"There is this wind going around that South African government is paying out some cash, like compensation to ex-miners. Would this be the bonuses we are talking about here? Please explain.",bonuses,,,
,Mmadi Masudi,"To some extent it is related to those bonuses being mentioned here. Remember these ex-miners were cut different taxes and contribution to their welfare such as death, coffins, burial places etc. but those who never accessed such funds have lost such funds. It is believed that some ex-miners with the help of other organization took the South African government to court over such unpaid bonuses and taxes by mining companies. The case was won, and South African government is forced to compensate those ex-miners in different countries including Malawi.",bonuses;taxes,,,
,EM:,"these were head tax paid by ex-miners without their knowledge. They only realized this when they came back home that they paid death, burial site, coffin taxes. So, since they were not paid back as they arrived alive in Malawi, such taxes are being claimed today by these ex-miners.",taxes,,,

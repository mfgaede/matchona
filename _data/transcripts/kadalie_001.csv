,,<h2>Autobiography of Robert Kadailie</h2>,,,,
,,[Some time in late June or early July 1909] I decided that the only thing to do now is to go to Rhodesia.,1900s,,,
,,All this time my friend was with me. 8 of us all Tonga fellows we left Blantyre for the Rhodesia via Tete.,Blantyre,,,
,,"We walk[ed] the whole day, about 6 O’Clock we arrived at Chikwawa. There at Chikwawa there is a river we must cross and we have to cross at [the] Boma (police camp).",transportation,,,
,,"The police refused that we cross the river, asking us if we can produce permit[s] or passes for Rhodesia. This we failed to produce, and we were ordered to return to Blantyre.",documentation;borders,,,
,,"We had what is called a conference of what we must do, to go back to cross the river. But how we are going to cross it[?]",borders,,,
,,"We went to a village, lower or down [the river, and] we asked the police [for permission] to sleep, this was given to us.",borders,,,
,,The police knew that there is no other place for us to cross except by the bridge which was by the camp.,borders,,,
,,Next morning we asked the native[s] to help us with their canoe. They also refused fearing that if the police heard that they let us cross in their canoe or boat they will be arrested.,borders,,,
,,This river which is know[n] as [the] Shire River is infested with croc[s]. Many natives in this place are being killed by the croc[s].,borders;dangers,,,
,,"We asked one another what must we do, to go back to Blantyre or to go on to Rhodesia[?] We must go.",borders,,,
,,Here you must observe that in Nyasaland there is no tribe braver than [the] Tonga tribe. Even the Government of that country depend most[ly] on [the] Tonga tribe.,borders;dangers,,,
,,"There is no office in Nyasaland without a Mtonga man there, kapetao[s] in every sphere of work in Nyasaland.",borders,,,
,,So in that morning we decided to cross the river croc[s] be damned. Our people are praying for us at home.,borders;dangers,,,
,,"We took off our clothes, to swim the river together, and believe me we cross the river without any of us killed or caught by Mr Crocodile.",borders;dangers,,,
,,[On the] other side we sing Chitonga hymn[s]. The native[s] of that place could not believe they ask how did you cross the river[?] [There are] so many crocs.,music;borders;dangers,,,
,,"Then we start to walk. It was July month and the month of July is a very hot month. [We follow] the river and stream all day, [and] from the river there to the next village we have to walk the whole day. We were so thirsty that most of us could not walk.",transportation;dangers,,,
,,6 O’Clock we reach the next village. There the people wish us kindly and gave us the place to sleep. On the 10th we left this village.,transportation,,,
,,"When [it was] about 12 O’Clock some fellows in the company start to drink some UCHEMA. This is the water the native[s] of that country drink. It comes out of a bark of a tree fall[s] in a cup then [you] drink it. Within 10 minutes a man is [so] drunk that he can hardly walk, even Scotch Whisky is not so strong as this water. (7) 5 out of 7 get drunk. They slept the whole of that afternoon.",alcohol;transportation,,,
,,"About 5 O’Clock we start to walk to [the] next village, arriving there [at] 7 pm. To my surprise at this village I find a wife of a man of our village at home. She welcome[s] us so nicely that we stayed two days at this place, and from here to PEA border is only 6 miles. ",transportation;borders,,,
,,"The morning of 13th we left this place going toward Tete, the capital of PEA. At about 12 O’Clock we arrive at the border, and about 5 O’Clock we came to a big village.",transportation;borders,,,
,,Here we met 4 white men. These white men were recruiting African[s] for certain mines in S. Rhodesia. ([They] had also 4 African women as their wives.) They asked us if we can speak English.,selection process;miner;marriage;language,,,
,,"Out of 7 of us, only two could speak and understand English and they chose us two, myself and a fellow Jacob from Chituka Village, him as a cook, myself as a recruiting agent. I went again to Blantyre.",selection process;language;chef;recruiter;Blantyre,,,
,,"There I got [a] lot of Ngoni. When I came with them to Chikwawa, I could not cross the river with them. The Police refused. I met these policemen at Blantyre.  I explain[ed] the position to them, they told me that the Govt. of Nyasaland won’t want them to pay £40 (forty) to enable them to recruit the people. This they couldn’t pay. ",borders;recruiter,,,
,,"I have to return again to the PEA with about a dozen men of my tribe whom I smuggled through the Nyasaland border to PEA. From there they were sent to a certain mine in S. Rhodesia. I doubt if they ever went to that mine. We asked our employer to pay us the wages due to us. This they couldn’t pay, and we found out that they got no money. That day we decided to leave them and ran away.",borders;recruiter;wages,,,
,,"This we did on the night of August 15th 1909. We left there without no provision[s]. We slept on [arrival at the] next village. We left next morning about 5 am. We walk[ed] the whole day [with] no food, going to Tete. 6 O’Clock we stop on a village. There we slept. Following day we again walk the whole day. 4.30 pm we arrived at Tete.",transportation,,,
,,"We cross Zambezi River to the other side where the town is situated, where I hope to meet a kinsman of mine, one Wilson Kayitandane. That was the 17th of August. There I remain, looking for work.",family;transportation,,,
,,"Mr Kayitandane ask[s] me to proceed to a place higher up the Zambezi river, about two days journey, to work there as a storekeeper of the Mandala Store (ALC). I could not accept the position because I was very young to go and work among the people I does [not] know of.",storekeeper,,,
,,"As rumour has it, the people there, some of them were savage [and] believe[d] too much in witchcraft. Then I met some of the fellows who come with us from Blantyre and left us with those four Europeans. ",witchcraft,,,

We came in contact with him near Blantyre as we were on our way to Rhodesia in search of work. From Blantyre he took us to Shiromo, and then on to Chindi where he handed us over to another European. From Chindi we proceeded by boat to Delgoa Bay. Immediatley on our arrival at Delgoa Bay we were entrained for Forodela where we were asked to hand over our BNP passes. We refused to hand them over. We were approached twice for our passes with the same result. Portuguese passes were then handed to us which we accepted not knowing what they were as we had never been in Portuguese territory previously. The reason we did not hand over our BNP travelling passes was because Mr Skinner had warned us explicitly not to do so. We arrived in Johannesburg six years ago and have had the sum of £1 deducted from our wage six times…We look to the British Government to request the Portuguese authorities to refund us these amounts.’ 19/05/1915.

Arriving at Chinde after 4 or 5 days, there we left again for Beira, where we were transferred to a big steamer known as Africa Listen. After a day and [a] half we reached Delagoa bay, from there we were put on a train. It was my first time to ride in the train.",housing;transportation,,,
,,We came off at Fortes. There we stayed a week and [a] half. We entrain for Johannesburg. I was selected [from] among 500 to contract on as a[n] office boy.

,,"One morning, when I came to work, as I slept to [at?] my uncle[’s] that morning, a mine police got hold of me when entering at the gate. When asking the reason he march[ed] me to the mine shaft. I dressed in tip-top treat that morning. There to my surprise I was told that I am going to work down below, no office office work for me, what with all my nice clothes.",miner;clothing;family;housing,,,

,,"I was carried and thrown in the skip. Down I went. There I was give[n] to a Scotchman. ",miner,,,
,,"If you look at this miner you’ll thin[k] that he was one of those saint[s] which we read about in the Bible, among the son of Benjamin. ",miner,,,
,,"He was the bully of [the] mine, other white men fear him, even [the] shift-boss[es] when they came [in]to his sight or quarter[s], first they must look for him before they do anything otherwise there will be trouble. ",miner,,,
,,"To this man I was sent to work with. He asked me if I [had] ever handle[d a] drill hammer. I says, ‘no sir.’ ‘To hell with you don’t call me sir you must say boss. If I hear you call me sir again I’ll give sjamboks.’ ",miner,,,
,,"Well I was given a hammer drill, and put me to a certain place to drill. I drilled until two O’Clock. I could never even drill a foot in that (sol[i]d) hard rock. Mind you in this ma[i]n (site), or sight as it is called in the mine, there were more than 40 workers from Nyasaland or (BCA) as it was in those days. ",miner,,,
,,"Knock off time the boss must come and examine the hole. If a man drilled say 3 ft he will be given a ticket marked loafer. From 4 to 6 ft you got your ticket, that means you got the 2/- which is mark[ed] in the ticket. When you get loafer that mean[s] that you have work[ed] all that day for nothing. So it goes in the mine[s].",miner,,,
,,"When my boss came to examine the hole[s], I must be there as an interpreter because none of these men from Nyasaland could speak English, even Zulu language. ",miner;language,,,
,,"Well to tell the truth, at Tete none of us gave Mr Skinner our own names. Mine was Isaac for that matter. My father was Makuzi.",miner,,,
,,"‘Isaac,’ called my boss. ‘Yes boss.’ ‘Come here, ask this fellow why he only drilled only 3 ft.’ ‘Well boss he says that he can’t drill more than that. The rock is very hard for him.’ ‘Tell him to go to HELL and tell him him I am going to give sjamboks if [this] goes on’,",miner,,,
,,"10, 5 so on. He had a terrible sjambok if he hit a man himself. It is terrible unless otherwise his boss boy heat you or sjambok you.",miner,,,
,,"Now he comes to my own side, [and] put[s] his ruling stick in the hole. ‘Great Scott,’ he will exclaim, ‘what this not even a foot for [the] whole [of] this day.’ Trying to explain to him and beg him without success [a] sjambok given by Jim his boss boy. It went on day after day until one day the stone hit me between the line in my back.",miner;injuries,,,
,,"I was sent to hospital and those boys who were working in that sight, all got [a] kicking for letting a stone escape from their working place. I stayed in hospital only one week. The wound was not healed, yet when I was sent back in the mine needed you, there [was] no interpreter.",miner;injuries,,,
,,"I went back alas I could do nothing, yet I was forced to work. I can’t refuse because I am just like a slave. This mine paid so much for me to Mr Skinner far away in PEA, the fellow eating my sweat.",miner,,,
,,I decided to bolt. It is no use. So young to work in the mine hard even Sunday I work like that. I made preparation.,absenteeism;miner,,,
,,"There were plenty [of my] countrymen somewhere in a town known as Maraisburg. One Saturday I wear three shirts, [a] coat and trousers, the rest I smuggle in the gate like [I] am going to the shop. I took [a] train. ",clothing;transportation;Johannesburg;absenteeism,,,
,,"I was received by my people and on Monday I start work in the mine as a ticket collector. Before that month was finish[ed], Nov[ember] 1909, someone wrote or went to the Company Manager and told him where I was. The result, [on] Sunday coming to the compound a native police from that mine was waiting for me at the gate. ",absenteeism;miner,,,
,,"He brought a letter from the Compound Manager of that mine where I ran away from. My present CM told him if, as they said, that the said Isaac is working in this mine wait at the gate and you’ll see him when he comes in from underground. So he waited for me. I was nearly caught. ",absenteeism;miner,,,
,,"Thank [my] luck[y] star[s] I had one of my countrymen [who] pull[ed] me away just in front of this police boy. Murmuring in my own lingo, ‘don’t you see that police[man] from your ex mine[?]’ So I run to the married quarter until 8 O’Clock. This fellow is gone.",absenteeism;miner,,,

,,"Well, this informer wrote again to that Compound Manager, [telling him] that although his police boy failed to find me, I am there for certain. He even suggested to this CM to send the police early on Sunday and search the rooms of the Blantyre[s], as we were known.",absenteeism;miner,,,
,,"This they did the second month. My luck[y] star was again with me. That Saturday I took [a] special pass to Joburg, [and] luck[il]y I left Saturday. Early Sunday morning the[y] search[ed] all our rooms. ‘No Isaac.’ ",absenteeism,,,
,,"The[y] arrested Akimaleck, he [had] run away from [the] Pass Office the Nyasa police boy knew him, from Tete, so he was taken, instead of me. The Compound Manager was not please[d]. ‘I want Isaac. Dead or alive bring him to me.’",absenteeism,,,
,,"When I return[ed] from Joburg my people told me about the raid, and they warn[ed] me that one day my lucky star may desert me. The best way is that I should leave the mine since I was not under contract. I agree. ",absenteeism,,,
,,"Before I went, this is what happened. Akimaleck wanted to gain his freedom, [and] told [the] CM that although I was not arrested that I was not present that Sunday.  If [t]he Compound Manager gave[/permitted] it police (mine), he will go with them, to that mine, he is going to lead them down to the Jew Store known as [the] Kaffir Eating Houses.",absenteeism,,,
,,He will go to the Compound and intice me to come with him to the store. There the police will arrest me. This suggestion pleases the CM.,absenteeism,,,
,,"On a certain day in December/January 1910, he came with four police boys. He left them as arranged, came to the compound [and] explain[ed] to us his mission. Dozen[s] of our people, including Akimaleck himself, armed [themselves] with sticks. He in front went to the police telling them that they must go to the group, I am among them. They advance. This they shall never forget to their dying days.",absenteeism,,,
,,"My people gave them such a good thrashing that each one went back with two or three holes in his head and blood running in their uniform. The[y] run towards Maraisburg township where they must catch [a] train to Germiston. The[y] went even without Akimaleck. He also was never caught. After that I left the mine. ",absenteeism,,,
,,"I stayed with my cousin in Nancefield Location. Feb March no work. April I got [a] job as a house boy, washing, waiter etc. 7 Gentlemen with only a house keeper. I was there three weeks. The work was too much for me, [e]specially [the] washing [and] waiting at the table. ",family;domestic servant;waiter,,,

,,"‘Oh I see,’ he went [on] his way, myself to Edward[’s] house. About 10 O’Clock [the] next morning the messenger came to say that I was wanted by the Compound Manager.

I hear the police man say, ‘Is this the boy who stole bread[?]’ This police man although police who care[s] two pence for an African, asked my name and where I came from, and how I stole bread. ‘Where was I taking the bread[?]’ I explain to him everything. Edward was called as a witness.",dangers,,,
,,"That lucky star of mine again came to my rescue. For [the] first time in my life, I say, a police man acted as a magistrate, when I finish [he] was [rational?] this what he says.",dangers,,,
,,"Mr [Curness?] that was the compound manager’s name. ‘I am afraid,’ said the man of [the] law, ‘I cannot arrest this boy for this offence. He may get four month[s] for nothing. It is better for you to pay him off, [and] also give [him] his pass.' He rose from his chair [getting] on his horse back off he went. ",dangers,,,
,,"Outside the office there were more than 100 mine boys. When they saw me, believe me, the CM felt so small, the whole crowd shout ‘Hurrah.’ I was very nice to every one in the compound as far as food was concerned because everything was in my hand (eatable).",social life,,,
,,"Tom my friend, hearing that I am leaving, he also tender[ed] his resignation. He was paid off. Away we went to [the] Pass Office. My boss Mr Snell was very sorry for me. A month after this incident I went to Witbank with one of Chituka man, Arthur Chimbaza. [see note]",Witbank,,,

,,"A house was built named this pit, here I must wait and examine the boys’ ticket[s]. Now at that time [the] Transvaal was very cold, and a [gilly?] is lighted in this small house and the house became very hot indeed. This were the cause of my getting [the] sack by my kinsman.",miner,,,
,,"You will hear this [gilly] made me so sleepy the result was that the boy[s] sung me [to] sleep so they began to come out without their ticket signed. This went on for for a week, and the head clerk, [t]he said kinsman of mine, found out in the compound that many boys, their ticket is not signed.",miner,,,
,,He was surprised because he knew that there is no other place where the boys can come out. He asked me [and] I told him that I know no one to come by the pit without his ticket signed.,miner,,,

There he ordered me to pack my things and go that same day.",miner,,,

,EM:,"So, the contract was for two years, is it?",,,,
,AM:,"Yes, it was for two years indeed. But for the first visit only lasted 11 months ",,,,
,EM:,"Oh, 11 months why? What happened?",,,,

,AM:,"I was motivated by my peers who were all going to South Africa to work in the mines. ",friends,,,
,EM:,"Oh, so it was about seeing your friends leaving and coming that motivated you?",friends,,,
,AM:,"Yes. Imagine we imitated what friends were up to. Whenever one marries, you were immediately challenged to follow suit. In this case most of my friends were leaving to work in the mines. I had to do likewise.",friends,,,
,EM:,"So, you were also forced to leave for South Africa to work in the mines like your peers?",,,,
,AM:,"Yes, I was forced to do likewise",,,,
,EM:,I see. And were you married before you left for South Africa?,marriage,,,
,AM:,"Yes, I was married.",marriage,,,

,EM:,"So, where did you leave the wife and the child?",children;marriage,,,
,AM:,"That time, we were all living at my wife’s house. (Matrimonial) So, I had to leave them there at her family’s place",children;marriage,,,
,EM:,"Oh, I see, you had to leave them with her family? Oh. Ok that’s great. Now that you made up your mind to follow your friends to WNLA, what did you do then?",marriage;family;friends;WNLA,,,
,AM:,I had to go to the Traditional Authority to get the authority,Traditional Authorities,,,
,EM:,What was the authority for?,Traditional Authorities,,,
,AM:,That I can ably travel to South Africa. Without that authority you can not be considered for the contract,Traditional Authorities;transportation,,,
,EM:,So where else did you go after obtaining such authority?,Traditional Authorities;transportation,,,
,AM:,I had to go the labour office. We were leaving from there,Traditional Authorities,,,
,EM:,"Oh, I see. Now that you were to get labour officers organize for you, did you have to bribe any of them that you are considered?",corruption,,,
,AM:,Not at all. That never happened to me. I was only told to go home to wait for the numbers of those travelling with me. We left when the number is reached,corruption;transportation,,,
,EM:,"Oh, I see. I thought you had to give some kickbacks to the officers for them to look at your application favorably. ",corruption;transportation,,,
,AM:,Not at all,corruption,,,
,EM:,"Now you are at Labour Office, what was the determinant factor that marked that you are ready, or you are a fit for the WNLA contract?",WNLA;health,,,
,AM:,"What happened was this. When you arrive at the Labour Office, they register you, and when number is reached, they take you to Blantyre, at WNLA house. After two or three days at WNLA, they brought you to the doctor. When the doctor finds you fit, then the journey is ready for you. They took you to the airport for the flight.",health;WNLA;transportation,,,
,EM:,"So, you were flying by airplane to South Africa?",transportation,,,
,AM:,"Yes, we used to fly by airplane.",transportation,,,
,EM:,Who was responsible for the flight tickets?,transportation,,,
,AM:,Government of Nyasaland was paying for our air tickets,transportation,,,
,EM:,"So, it was government of Nyasaland not South Africa?",transportation,,,
,AM:,"No, it was Nyasaland with the agreement of South African government as it wanted people to work in its mines.",transportation,,,
,EM:,"when you are almost ready, how did you know?",transportation,,,
,AM:,They could tell us that all the processes are over and we are leaving on such a date,transportation,,,
,EM:,Ok,transportation,,,
,AM:,"Today you are to sleep at Ngumbe, with the flight tomorrow at Chileka Airport. That marked that everything is ready",transportation,,,
,EM:,But others had to travel by trains?,transportation,,,
,AM:,"Yes, others travelled through the train. But in our case, we flew to Botswana where we got the train to Johannesburg.",transportation;Johannesburg,,,
,EM:,"Alright. So, you flew to Botswana and then got into a train to Mzilikazi?",transportation,,,
,AM:,Yes. And it was at Mzilikazi where we were distributed accordingly to our respective working place.,,,,
,EM:,What happens further?,,,,
,AM:,"They give you a form of a contract (like that I showed you) and they drop you your mine. When you arrive, they did a few tests on you. They took a picture of you. When the results arrive, they call you and get them and if you had diseases, they would send you to the hospital for treatment.",medicine,,,
,EM:,"Oh really. So, if they found you with some disease, they send you to the hospital and not send you back home?",health,,,
,AM:,"No, they took you to the hospital, when you are healed, that’s when they sent you to your designated mine to start work. However, there some disease that they could easily send you back home. For instance, epilepsy. ",health,,,
,EM:,"Oh, I see. So what was your mine?",,,,
,AM:,St Helena,,,,
,EM:,"Oh, St Helena! I see",,,,
,AM:,"Yes. If everything okay, you were introduced to your mine",,,,
,EM:,"Now that you are at your designated mine, what happened thereafter?",,,,
,AM:,"When proven fit, then the doctor is called for further testing right at the mine. ",health,,,
,EM:,Oh! They had to test you again. What was the rational?,health,,,
,AM:,"Yes, they did that again to determine your fitness and allocation into the mine. Before they allocate you area of operation, they wanted to know your fitness",health,,,
,EM:,"After allocation what else? ",,,,
[00:15:28],AM:,"They could then allocate us work position, and accommodation. The beds, and rooms. And when you get into the room, you would find someone to welcome you, called izioda",izibondo,,,
,EM:,Iziboda?,izibondo,,,
,AM:,"Yes Izibonda. He welcomes you to the room and gives you the rules. For instance, remember tomorrow to wake up early, and would give some directions on how to behave within the mine. You are here to work hard, and don’t be absent from work unnecessarily.",izibondo,,,
,EM:,"Oh, okay",izibondo,,,
,AM:,"He could tell us the meal timetables, discipline issues, etc.",izibondo,,,
,EM:,"So would the iziboda coming from Zimbabwe, Mozambique and other countries?",izibondo,,,
,AM:,"No no, always from your own country. Like in my case he was a Malawian and from same district back home",izibondo,,,
,EM:,"Oh, I see. So, each country would have their own iziboda?",izibondo,,,
,AM:,Yes. That helped for the language and culture. We could connect and unite ourselves.,izibondo,,,
,EM:,"Oh, that was good. So, you were very united and connected? No gossip?",izibondo,,,
,AM:,"Oh yes, we were very connected when we are on our own. As we were all men, no gossip at all.",izibondo,,,
,EM:,"So, in your rooms would you be able to watch TVs or radios?",entertainment;radio,,,
,AM:,Ohmmm not really. But what the azungu (white people) did was to create a big hall where on Saturdays we could recreate with others. We could watch cinemas from there.,entertainment;movies,,,
,EM:,"Oh, that was fantastic. So, what was the kind of films or movies shown?",entertainment;movies,,,
,AM:,"Normally were like games, hatches, and football. Whenever we were tired you could just leave and go to bed. Mostly about the white people nothing African.",entertainment;movies;football,,,
,EM:,Oh! Mostly European not African?,,,,
,AM:,Yes mostly.,,,,
,EM:,Was that compulsory? That you had to go and watch that?,entertainment,,,
,AM:,Not at all. You had the freedom not to go to watch especially if you tired.,entertainment,,,
,EM:,"Wow! So, they treated you as matured people with rights?",,,,
,AM:,They indeed respected us as adults. We enjoyed the treatment as well.,,,,
[00:18:08],EM:,What about your mine managers? Did they treat say Malawians as special to other nationals? That may be Malawians were hard workers as compared to the South Africans?,,,,
,AM:,"Ah no ways. There was nothing of such nature, we were treated equally. You know we were so many. Millions going in and out through the same doors. But inside the mines each working at different areas, sections of the mines, with different captains. So, we were indeed taken good care of, without racism, whatsoever.",,,,
,EM:,Oh ok. How about radios in the mines? Would you be listening to during your recreation time?,entertainment;radio,,,
,AM:,"Yes, we could at least only the local radios. Like the area I was working, you had Sesotho radios and English here and there. But if a Malawian would want to come to chat with you from another hostel, he would first meet the hostel police. He could introduce himself and ask for particular room or bed number as the person he wanted to visit. So, if I was in the bath, I would jump out to welcome him in our own local language, mostly Chichewa. We would hug and welcome each other in our local way.",entertainment;radio;language,,,
,EM:,"So, meaning you could create friendships with Malawians and also with other nationals like Zambians?",friends,,,
,AM:,"Yes, we could have such friendships though each nation had their own designated line. But we could mix and create friendships with each other, Shangani’s, Mapodo, Zulus and Zambians",friends;Shangaan people,,,
,EM:,"So, there were no deliberate limitations as Malawians should only befriend Malawians?",,,,
,AM:,Not at all. There were no such racist demarcations,,,,
,EM:,"By the time you were leaving for South Africa, did you have any school?",education,,,
,AM:,"No. I did not go to school. Where I live here, is far away from where schools were in those years. The only school was at Mpondasi and is quite a distance from here.",education,,,
,EM:,"Oh, I see. So, it was there with the white missionaries?",education,,,
,AM:,"That’s true, they brought it there first before here. Schools here came very recently with Kamuzu (Dr Hastings Banda).",education;Dr. Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,"Oh right! So during your days in the mines, what language were you using to communicate with others?",language,,,
,AM:,We used one language called chi lapalapa (fanakalo). (22:14),language;Fanakalou,,,
,EM:,Oh lapalapa?,language;Fanakalou,,,
,AM:,"Yes. Fanakalo, buya, (come here); omu nanda? (Where are you going?).",language;Fanakalou,,,
,EM:,"So, this language was applicable while at work inside the mines?",language;Fanakalou,,,
,AM:,"First we started learning it when we arrived for one weeks if you are sharp, two or more weeks if you are not sharp enough.",language;Fanakalou,,,
,EM:,Oh ok,language;Fanakalou,,,
,AM:,"It was especially difficult in our first trip, but became simpler second time around as we got used to speaking it ",language;Fanakalou,,,
,EM:,"Since you were all men in the mines. Were there a time you felt like having sex amongst yourselves? Or even outsourcing from the nearby towns, villages?",homosexuality;dating,,,
,AM:,"Ohmmm not really. Especially where my mine was, ohm too far from the main towns. So, it was not possible. But I can’t say completely that it was taking place. Remember we were too many people, millions of workers.",homosexuality;dating,,,
,EM:,"I understand but you know we hear of such stories in prisons where men have sex with other men. ",homosexuality;dating,,,
,AM:,"Ohmmm we could hear such stories, but we never witnessed such things with my eyes.",homosexuality,,,
,EM:,How about the iziboda? Weren’t they demanding sex from his men?,izibondo;homosexuality,,,
,AM:,"Oh, not all. I was one of the iziboda and I never demanded any sex. I was a leader and had to lead by example",izibondo;homosexuality,,,
,EM:,"Oh really? So, I am talking to an iziboda? So that is why you are also a chief here? They saw the good qualities in you.",izibondo,,,
,AM:,"Laughs lungs out. ",izibondo,,,
,EM:,"While in the mines, would you find time to go to the mosques or churches for prayers?",religion,,,
,AM:,"Ohm where I used to work, there were only few Indians as they were the ones building mosques. It was too far therefore to access any mosque.",religion,,,
,EM:,"Oh yes. Free State was definitely very far from Johannesburg. ",Johannesburg,,,
,AM:,"Yes so, I could hardly travel. If anything would be by train. Long distance",transportation,,,
,EM:,"While working in the mines, did it ever come into your mind to change mine work to work elsewhere say as garden boy etc?",absenteeism,,,
,AM:,"Oh no way, I enjoyed working in the mines.",,,,
,EM:,"Oh, so you had no problem?",,,,
,AM:,"Oh, not really. Although the work was hard, but we never thought of running away as we knew what brought us there. We learnt to persevere as men",absenteeism,,,
,EM:,"So, there were no strikes whatsoever?",strikes/labour protests,,,
,AM:,"Strikes? No, ways. Because as Malawians, I was their leader, their Traditional Authority like. Same with other nationals",strikes/labour protests;Traditional Authority,,,
,EM:,"Now you remind me the powers the Traditional Authority had. When you were starting of with your journey, you had to get permission from your T/A. What would have happened if he refused his men from travelling to the mines?",Traditional Authority;transportation,,,
,AM:,"I don’t think he would have done that. First, he checked if you had paid full government taxes, if you did then he had no reason to refuse you his permission or authority.",Traditional Authority;transportation;taxes,,,
,EM:,"Oh, so you had to be in good books with the taxman? ",Traditional Authority;taxes,,,
,AM:,"Yes, to make sure you don’t owe anything the Government. You are not running away from criminal acts. You are sorely going to work, for employment. However, when we got to Blantyre, the government returned the tax money back to us.",taxes,,,
,EM:,"That’s great. Now tell me, while in the mines did you ever make any relationship with other miners?",,,,
,AM:,"Yes. I did with other Malawians. Especially those we put up with in the same hostel. The other nationals, we could only greet each other, kunjani? (How are you?) sikhona, (Am fine) etc. but with Malawians we could chat more about our tribes, districts we came from, languages etc. And for your information I still chat with those around here in Mpondasi.",language,,,
,EM:,"Oh, that’s great. Back to the mines. What about diseases? Like TB, wasn’t that an issue? What was the company doing?",tuberculosis,,,
,AM:,Ohm some got it from home and others while in the mines,tuberculosis,,,
,EM:,"So, what happened when they find you with TB while working the mines? Were they sending you back home or they kept you there?",tuberculosis,,,
,AM:,Whenever you were found with TB the company took care of you by sending you to the hospital for treatment.,tuberculosis,,,
,EM:,"So, they took care of you guys?",health,,,
,AM:,"Of yes, they really looked after us in every aspect",health,,,
,EM:,"By the way, I am repeating this question. In those days while being served by the labour officers, were at any point where they asked for kickbacks or bribe to process your application?",corruption,,,
,AM:,Not all. There was no corruption,corruption,,,
,EM:,"Oh, okay unlike these days. So how much were you earning at the mines?",wages,,,
,AM:,"They were paying us 10 cents per day. Last trip they could pay me at least R6 and they cut half R3 they gave me, and the rest (R3) was remitted to my savings account back home.",wages;remittances,,,
,EM:,what do you mean when you say cut?,wages;remittances,,,
,AM:,They used to give half and the other half back home,wages;remittances,,,
,EM:,How were they sending that money.,wages;remittances,,,
,AM:,"The company paid directly to the account they opened for us before coming over. All the money was deposited there, and we could access it only when we got back home. In case we died while away, we had to name our next of keen to receive my money and bonuses. So, when we arrived in Blantyre, we went to WNLA depot to access our savings account and our saved money. Each had his own money. ",wages;remittances;WNLA,,,
,EM:,"So, in your case, that you went several times, were you given some extra incentives? And were you given your bonuses of the first and second trips when you arrived for the third trip?",wages;bonuses,,,
,AM:,No. they were only given what they owed you per each trip.,bonuses,,,
,EM:,"Was that money they cut and saved in your account, was it accessible to your parents and or wife?",wages;remittances;family;marriage,,,
,AM:,"No. The money was kept by the bank and was not given to anyone. But periodically WNLA was giving moneys to our family back home while we were still away. This was a thank you money, Zikomo, or courtesy. This was not coming from the money saved in our saving accounts at all.",remittances;wages;WNLA;family,,,
,EM:,Were you able to send some cash to your family from the money you received while in South Africa?,remittances,,,
,AM:,Yes we would do that.,remittances,,,
,EM:,What were they using that money for?,remittances,,,
,AM:,"Basic items like clothes and food, It was not easy for sure that you could buy many things from that money",remittances;purchases,,,

,AM:,"I bought radio, bicycle, clothes, blankets to show my people that am back.",purchases;radio;bicycles;clothing,,,

,AM:,I bought when we arrived in Blantyre. And I built a house when I got back from the third journey.,purchases;housing,,,
,EM:,Was this of iron sheets?,housing,,,
,AM:,"No, a thatched house. Iron sheets were scarce and expensive. Imagine one was at K50.",housing,,,
,EM:,"Oh yes, imagine you receiving K30 and aiming at buying iron sheets?",,,,
,AM:,No ways. It was difficult.,,,,
,EM:,"During your time, didn’t you face any apartheid /uprising aspects in and outside the mines?",apartheid,,,
,AM:,"Oh no ways. We hardly experienced that. We were concentrating on our work. We were on a contract, so the other issues did not affect us",apartheid,,,
,EM:,"As you were on a contract, did it come into your mind, or a situation forced you to think of ending your contract and go and look for new jobs outside?",,,,
,AM:,"No, I never thought of leaving. But I have heard of others leaving the mines and got new jobs outside. Others too, left the mines and walked back home, that I heard.",,,,
,EM:,"The period you left first, 1964 and 1966, Malawi became independent. Malawi became free from the British rule, how did that affect you?",1964 Malawian independence,,,
,AM:,"Honestly, politics did not affect me. Actually, my second trip was when Kamuzu Banda was the president, very powerful then.",Hastings Kamuzu Banda,,,
,EM:,You first left home (Malawi) in 1964 and you returned in 1966. What motivated you to return home? You could have decided otherwise and remained there doing other jobs.,returning home;1960s,,,
,AM:,"Actually, when you considered our daily problems at home, when you worked hand to mouth, I had no problem coming back to South Africa to work in the mines. So, to answer your question, I returned home primarily to renew my contract for another two years. ",returning home,,,
,EM:,"So, you mean, you returned to renew your contract?",returning home,,,
,AM:,"Yes. Since I had to go back to the chief to get authorization and application to go back. ",returning home;Traditional Authority,,,
,EM:,You mean you had to go through the same process when renewing your contract?,returning home;Traditional Authority,,,
,AM:,"Yes, we had to go back to the Traditional Authority and then to the labour office etc.",returning home;Traditional Authority,,,

,AM:,"Go ahead, it will be good for the future generation access this.",,,,
,EM:,What about the current issue of compensation. What is it about?,,,,
,AM:,"The government officials told us that anyone who went to work in the mines will be given a compensation, to thank us for the work we did. It is my hope that they can honour that. We are really suffering right now. That money can push us to another level.",,,,
,EM:,Who is going to pay you? Malawi government or South African?,,,,
,AM:,We are told that the South African government will do the payment. It would be my pleasure if you can help us receive these bonuses.,,,,
,EM:,Thank you for trusting me. I will with my team talk to government officials about this ordeal,,,,
,AM:,Thank you and that marks the end of our interview.,,,,

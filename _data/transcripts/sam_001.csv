,Ronnie Banda (RB),"“My father was a linguist – he could speak fluent Afrikaans, he could speak Portuguese, he could speak all these African languages Xhosa, Zulu, Tswana, Peggi, he learnt them whilst he was here...and you would be surprised my father could not speak Chichewa which is our main language and he could speak all these languages, Zulu, Xhosa...When he left South Africa and worked in Zimbabwe, he was a train steward and he was travelling out of the country...he could speak Portuguese, but he hadn’t been to Mozambique.” ",,,,
,,"Sam Banda was born in 1918, a Tonga from Chiperembe, Nkhata Bay. He did not tell Ronnie much about his parents but his father was probably a farmer. ",,,,
,RB,Sam was schooled at Bandawe Mission School and for that time “he was regarded as someone who had achieved everything as far as education is concerned.” ,,,,
,,"He finished school around 1938, and for the following 12 years took part in the local fishing industry on Lake Nyasa which provided “the livelihood of the people along the lakeshore”. ",,,,
,RB,"He left for South Africa in 1950, “for greener pastures. Because by then there was very little that people could do in Malawi and with his education he was tempted to find greener pastures.” ",,,,
,,"Liaising with other ambitious young men, Sam walked as part of a large group from Nkhata Bay:",,,,
,RB,"“They would travel in a group of not less than 20 because you know the dangers along their route. Countries did not look [after animals] very well in terms of their game reserves - it was not as organised as it is today. They could travel in groups of not less than 20...”",,,,
,,"This group was led by experienced migrants –",,,,
,RB,"Within the group there were people who could direct them, who knew where they were going. And these could be hired, they could be paid.",,,,
,RB,"These ""navigators, people who could direct them this is the way how to get to South Africa, the route... on their arrival they would pay them whatever, you know was agreed upon – they would travel for 3 months.” ",,,,
,,"During his time in Cape Town, Sam met and socialised with fellow Tonga, Clements Kadalie.",,,,
,RB,"I think they might have a few things in common, because Clements Kadalie, he was an educated person, so was my father...",,,,
,,"Kadalie was his mentor.",,,,
,RB,"He would always mention Kadalie – very much looking up to him as a role model... he was amazed by his leadership skills – being a foreigner, being a person who could call the masses and listen to his views as far as the labour regulations were concerned. So he was very amazed by Clements Kadalie how he could organise people.",,,,
,RB,"He was very into suits...he liked his corporate attire...he liked also bow ties, and Wilson hats, with a feather on the side.",,,,
,,The ‘turn-up suit’ was his mainstay dress-code. In 1957 Sam left South Africa to work in Zimbabwe.,,,,
,RB,"He left Cape Town because he had information about Zimbabwe, when he compared the labour laws...even though they are under colonialism, people in Zimbabwe are far better than the local South Africans.",,,,

,,"Travelling by train to Zimbabwe in 1957, Sam was initially employed as a clerk on the Wankie mines. After only a short stint as a clerk, Sam however got a new job in Bulawayo, working as a steward on the Rhodesian Rail network - his language skills a crucial qualification for this highly regarded job, and one that must have been relatively well paid as Sam went on to buy shares in Rhodesian Railways – “for me that indicates someone who understood, you know, the economy of Zimbabwe, and who understood economics at large.” ",,,,
,,"It was during this period of time that Sam met Ronnie’s mother, Fanny, 18 years his junior. Fanny’s parents were also Malawian. Fanny's father, Joseph Chiumya, from Usisya, Nkhata Bay, had worked as a coal miner at Wankie from the 1930s. The couple married in 1959, with Fanny remaining a housewife throughout her married life. Whilst Sam worked as a steward, the young Banda family lived in Shabalala, Bulawayo until 1968. Jane was born in 1962, followed by Ronnie, Alice in 1965, Sam in 1967 and Lameck in 1969. ",,,,
,,"Having lived in Shabalala for almost a decade, in 1968 the Banda family moved to Mpopoma, “a fast-growing township with a lot of facilities, amenities”. Mpopoma was a more attractive area with “a lot of schools and transport system was very good, even the CCAP church we used to attend was nearby, by then in those standards it was a very developed township...it was a match-box house, but those days living in that house was a luxury, with a big yard.” ",,,,
,,"At the age of 53, in 1971 Sam returned to Malawi to start “a new life” - drawing on his earnings and pension from the Rhodesian Railways. Though he was happy to retire, a further motivation was the threat that his adopted son, Moses, who could have been drafted into the Zimbabwe Bush War. On their return however the family fell foul of numerous unfortunate events. ",,,,
,,"Whilst in South Africa and Zimbabwe, Sam had arranged for his cousin to build him a house in Blantyre. When he arrived in the city however this proved to be a shoddily built, mud-brick dwelling in Zingwangwa – a place “which my father never liked”. The Banda family soon relocated to a nice house elsewhere in Blantyre, but they were evicted after only a few weeks, as it transpired that the house actually belonged to a corrupt politician. On settling in a second house the family was again evicted on the same grounds. ",,,,
,,"Sam and Fanny’s 6th child, born in 1973, was named Masuzgo, meaning problems. “We were well-to-do by those standards in Zimbabwe, but when we got to Malawi...when my father came he came with the mind of opening up some businesses because he had enough money...When we arrived in Malawi, thinking that our uncle had organised the project for his in-laws, it was a total different story. We saw a small plot, with 3 doors and it was a muddy house – do you know such houses? That you would find in rural areas of Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania. So my father said ‘my friend, after sending you so much money I don’t understand what you did with the money. You know what you can take this and look for me another place, organise me another place and I will buy...all you can do is to help me find a complete house.’ And my uncle organised my father a house, it was a nice big house. After a month or so my father was confronted by the special branch of Malawi to say that the house belonged to a banned politician in Malawi so therefore we were given an ultimatum – 7 days to move out of the house.” The family then moved back to Zingwangwa; but this house also belonged to someone in opposition politics, so they were kicked out again. Sam eventually rented a house in Chilobwe, before moving again to Chimwangunda. However, by this time most of his money “had been taken by these rogues, people who conned him. All the money he spent on all these houses, he never got it back.” ",,,,

,,"Housing woes were coupled with an unsuccessful business. Returning to his old trade, Sam bought fish in Mangochi and transported it in his Land Rover to sell wholesale in Limbe. “This did not prove at all lucrative, and within a couple of months the business folded. He was not involved in politics, but fell foul of unfortunate circumstances... it was very difficult for him to prosper in that kind of business.” ",,,,
,,,,,,
,,  ,,,,
,,,,,,
,,"With the failure of his business and all his savings wiped, Sam returned to the South African hotel industry in 1973, travelling alone by bus via Zambia, Botswana, due to the conflict in Mozambique. He got a job in Berea, Pretoria at the Casa Mia Hotel, as a head waiter – due to his experience and communication skills. By the end of 1973 he had switched jobs to work at Germiston Lake. ",,,,
,,,,,,
,,  ,,,,
,,,,,,
,,"He nevertheless remained in contact with his family who remained in Blantyre. “My father liked Mkranda – traditional South African music – like Soul Brothers...each and every opportunity he could find when people were going to Malawi, friends, cousins, people that he knows – he would give them things to give to us...he could buy records and buys clothes, and he would give them to people.” He would also send money via telegram as well as through people. Sam and Fanny’s last child, Tokozile, was born in 1977. Meaning gift, this perhaps reflects the family’s improved circumstances. ",,,,

,,"In 1975 Sam called his adopted son Moses to join him, and Moses worked for Elna Sewing Machine Company as a sales rep from 1976 until 1982. ",,,,
,,,,,,
,,  ,,,,
,,,,,,
,,"In 1982 however, Moses was deported from South Africa, due to his involvement with the ANC. Joe Modise’s wife, Jackie Sedibe, had Chewa relatives, and Moses had helped with the the escape of the Modise girls from South Africa to Botswana - taking the girls, disguised as men, to Park Station to leave from the country. After the event however, the police found out about Moses' involvement and hearing this news Moses moved from Soweto. The pass laws of South Africa eventually caught up with him, and when it was discovered that he was not South African, Moses was deported. He nevertheless returned to South Africa in 1986 and found work as a parking attendant. Moses passed away in 2011. ",,,,

,,"In the same year, Sam Banda became very sick. Suffering from hyper-tension and a stroke, he decided to leave South Africa in 1982, to live with Fanny in Blantyre. He died the same year. Fanny lives in Blantyre to this day. ",,,,

,,"Despite his successful careers when abroad, his children lived relatively poorly and did not receive a good education. Ronnie however still sees his father’s emigration as a good thing.  “Sitting back and looking back at my father’s adventures in life, I realise that the economy of Malawi is very small...there isn’t much to do. And I realise that it was very difficult for a man to achieve his goals. When a man comes to South Africa a man can feed his family irrespective of the job that he is doing he can put food on the table...Unlike in Malawi, I don’t even know if there is a middle class in Malawi, it is someone who is into politics....just being an average, having an average education it is very hard. My father’s coming down to South Africa, it shaped who I am today and I thank him for that.” ",,,,

,,"In 1985, Ronnie got a contract to work on Rustenburg mine. “Malawians were non-militant people. They had very good skills in terms of mining – they were one of the very first people to go to the mines – my father told me they were there in the 1920s. Fast forward to 1985 this was the peak of Apartheid when your qualifications would mean nothing. The good thing about Malawians working in the mines, we were very obedient people, we were able to support our families working in the mines and we were non-militant. Because there were times when the local south Africans were going on strike, but we Malawians would avoid such things...Working on the mines it was a challenge – this is where we saw black-to-black segregation, but people could decide to go and do normal things if they wanted to do that...I was proud to be part of the foreign labourers working on the mines...because you know I am from a very poor background, so it could make a difference coming from me. Because you know we Blacks, we have a collective responsibility, if my parents are put up and my siblings are not working I’ve got that responsibility, that’s our African culture.” ",,,,

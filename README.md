## Malawians on the Move in 20th Century Southern Africa

This project is based on the [Oral History as Data](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/) framework and uses elements of [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) to include documents related to individual oral histories.

[Documentation for the earlier version of Oral History as Data](https://uidaholib.github.io/oral-history-as-data/about.html) is available from the University of Idaho, as well as [a lesson plan](https://learn-static.github.io/oral-history-as-data/). These resources were extremely valuable in the development of this project, as was the excellent [documentation for CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/).

### About this Project

Matchona was built to share the collaborative oral history work of a group of historians from Malawi, the United Kingdom, and the United States. I will endeavor to better document and rationalize the customizations I've made, which include small galleries of documents and photographs on transcript pages and clusters of subjects for easier browsing.
